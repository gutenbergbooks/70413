<br><span class="cheaderfont">A CABINET DISCUSSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The President of the United States shook his head
with an emphasis which caused the other men gathered
around the massive mahogany table to realize
that it would be almost a waste of time to pursue the
discussion. “It is my opinion, gentlemen, that if there
were the slightest basis for this rumor, Mr. Throgmorton’s
report would not be couched in such positive
terms!” he declared, pointing to a paper on the table
before him. “There isn’t a man in the diplomatic
service more alert or level-headed than he, so far as
I know. I am confident that it would be impossible
for Portiforo to pull the wool over his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Possibly Portiforo has not pulled the wool over
Throgmorton’s eyes,” the little man who sat at the
president’s right suggested quietly. “He may not have
found it at all necessary to do that.” There was
something about the speaker’s tone which caused the
other members of the cabinet to look at him curiously,
and prompted the president to ask, quite calmly:
“Will you say what you mean to imply by that remark,
Mr. Attorney General?”</p>

<p>The little man smiled—a peculiar form of smile
which seemed to be done with his eye only. “The
American minister to the Republic of Baracoa has<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
never given the impression of being exactly hostile to
the Portiforo administration,” he remarked dryly.</p>

<p>The president frowned. “Are we to understand this
as an insinuation against his good faith?”</p>

<p>“To be quite frank, Mr. President, I have never
credited Mr. Throgmorton with a superabundance of
good faith,” the attorney general replied. “I have
known him for a long time—in fact, we were at college
together, and—well, it would take more than his
unsupported word to convince me that there is no truth
in this startling story of Portiforo’s perfidy. He and
the President of Baracoa are reputed to be close
friends, and it is possible that his investigation might
not be unbiased.”</p>

<p>“I protest against that remark,” the secretary of
state exclaimed indignantly. “I, too, have known Mr.
Throgmorton for a long time, and there isn’t a man
living, Mr. President, in whose integrity I have greater
confidence. If this hideous thing were true he would
have told us so, no matter how amicably disposed he
might be toward the Portiforo administration.”</p>

<p>The president nodded an acquiescence. “I have as
much confidence in Throgmorton’s honesty as I have
in his good judgment,” he declared. “As I said before,
gentlemen, he is too conservative a man to have
made such a positive denial unless he had good ground
for doing so. I have felt all along that this rumor
was nothing more than a concoction of Portiforo’s enemies;
now I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“And nothing would cause you to change your mind,
Mr. President?” the attorney general inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>“I would not say that. I am always open to conviction.
Of course, if you could bring me a photograph
of Felix in a dungeon cell, I might be ready to
believe that Portiforo has him in captivity. But even
at that,” he added, a twinkle in his eyes, “I would have
to be convinced that the snapshot was genuine.”</p>

<p>The attorney general smiled deprecatingly. “Then
I’m afraid it will never be possible to convince you,
Mr. President. I don’t imagine that there’s a photographer
in all the world who could break into a
South American dungeon, snapshot a prisoner, and
get out again.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” put in the secretary of
the interior. “I know of one man who might be able
to accomplish even that remarkable feat. He’s a New
York newspaper man named Hawley. He’s on the
staff of the <cite>Sentinel</cite>. I met him some months ago,
when I was in New York, and the experience I had
with him then leads me to believe that there is scarcely
any feat impossible of accomplishment where he is
concerned.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the man they call ‘the Camera Chap’?”
the president inquired, evincing keen interest.</p>

<p>“I believe they do call him that,” the secretary of
the interior replied. “He is truly a wonderful photographer.
I believe that if Portiforo really has Felix
locked up in El Torro Fortress, Hawley could get a
picture of him.”</p>

<p>The president made no comment on this, but, later
that day, when the cabinet meeting was over, he said
to his secretary: “I wish you would send word to<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
Mr. Bates, of the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite>, that I would
like to see him at his earliest convenience.”</p>

<p>Bates, the <cite>Sentinel’s</cite> Washington correspondent,
hurried over to the White House immediately upon
receipt of this information, hoping that the head of
the nation contemplated favoring his paper with some
exclusive information. What the latter actually said
to him caused him some mystification.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bates,” the president began, “I believe you
have a photographer named Hawley employed on your
paper?”</p>

<p>“You mean the Camera Chap, Mr. President?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have heard a great deal about his exploits,
and if what I have heard is true, he must be
a very unusual fellow. Tell me more about him, if
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Sentinel’s</cite> star correspondent launched into the
subject with enthusiasm. There was not a man on
his paper, from the editor in chief down to the youngest
office boy, who was not proud of the fact that
Frank Hawley was connected with it. The Camera
Chap occupied a position unique in the newspaper
world. He commanded a large salary, and his extraordinary
achievements had made him famous in
every newspaper office in the country, and caused other
managing editors to envy the <cite>Sentinel</cite> for having him
under contract.</p>

<p>It took Bates more than half an hour to tell of some
of Hawley’s most notable performances, and the president’s
face lighted up as he listened. “Why,” he exclaimed<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
enthusiastically, “the Camera Chap must be
a remarkable character! Does he ever come to Washington?
I should very much like to meet him. You
might make it a point to mention that to your managing
editor the next time you communicate with your
office, Mr. Bates.”</p>

<p>“I will be sure to do so, Mr. President,” said the
<cite>Sentinel</cite> representative, who, being far from dull-witted,
and well acquainted with the chief executive’s
methods, surmised that there was behind this request
some special motive.</p>

<p>As a result of the message which Bates sent over the
wire which connected the <cite>Sentinel’s</cite> Washington
bureau with the home office, a tall, slender young
man, with a prepossessing countenance and a twinkle
in his keen eyes, arrived at the capital the following
afternoon.</p>

<p>Bates greeted him effusively. “Welcome to our
city, Hawley, old man!” he exclaimed. “I don’t know
whether the president contemplates offering you a
position in his cabinet or whether he merely wants his
picture taken, but, whatever the reason, he’s very keen
to meet you. His secretary called me up this morning
to make sure you were coming; and when I told him
that you were on your way to Washington he sent
over this note for you.”</p>

<p>Bates handed Hawley a square envelope, on which
the address of the executive mansion was embossed.
The Camera Chap opened it, and read its contents over
twice, the expression of surprise on his face intensifying
as he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“Are you sure this isn’t a practical joke?” he inquired
half incredulously, handing Bates the note.</p>

<p>An envious look came to the other’s face as he
glanced at it. “That’s going some!” he exclaimed.
“You certainly are lucky, old man. Some of us
Washington correspondents pride ourselves on being
pals with the president, but he’s never invited any of
<em>us</em> to lunch at the White House.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A MATTER IN CONFIDENCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the Camera Chap went to keep his luncheon
appointment the following morning, Bates, who had
some business to attend to at the treasury department,
accompanied him as far as the White House grounds.
As they were walking along Pennsylvania Avenue, a
splendid touring car, with a silver crest on the door
panels and a liveried footman on the box, passed them
by. It contained two women, one of them a blonde,
the other very dark. The former, recognizing Bates
on the sidewalk, bowed graciously.</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Fred V. Cooper, wife of the attorney
general,” the correspondent explained to his companion,
noting that the latter was staring at the automobile,
as though fascinated. “She’s one of the beauties
of Washington.”</p>

<p>“And the other woman—the dark one—who is
she?” the Camera Chap demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Bates smiled. “There’s a woman with a history,”
he said. “She is Señora Francisco Felix, wife of the
former president of the Republic of Baracoa. You
remember reading about him, of course?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s the chap who disappeared a couple
of years ago.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared is a gentle way of putting it,” returned
the other, grinning. “He sneaked away in his
private yacht, one memorable night, and the good people
of Baracoa awoke next morning to find that they<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
were minus a president, and incidentally the greater
part of the national treasury. The scamp took away
with him every bolivar he could lay hands on. The
little republic would have gone bankrupt if General
Portiforo hadn’t stepped in and saved the situation.”</p>

<p>Hawley nodded. “Yes, I remember. What is his
wife doing in Washington?”</p>

<p>“She’s been living here ever since her husband absconded.
I guess she didn’t find it exactly comfortable
in Baracoa after the scandal. She and Mrs.
Cooper are great friends; they’ve known each other
since they were girls. The señora was educated in the
United States; I believe she and the attorney general’s
wife were in the same class at Vassar. She—why,
what’s the matter, old man?”</p>

<p>Hawley had given vent to a sharp exclamation, at
the same time gripping his companion’s arm excitedly.
“Did you notice that swarthy chap in the taxicab
which just passed?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The fellow with a beard? Yes. What about
him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t happen to know who he is, do you?”</p>

<p>Bates shook his head. “I suppose he’s connected
with one of the Spanish-American embassies. There
are so many of those fellows running around Washington
that it isn’t possible for us to know them all.
Why the interest in him?”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the first time I have seen him. I saw
him in New York a couple of weeks ago. He was
shadowing Señora Felix.”</p>

<p>“Señora Felix!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; this is not the first time I’ve seen her, either,
although I did not know who she was until now. The
other day, Bates, I witnessed a queer incident outside
the Hotel Mammoth. I was passing there just as that
woman came out of the Thirty-fourth Street entrance
and entered a taxicab. My attention was attracted to
her not only because of her striking beauty, but because
of the nervousness she displayed. As she stepped
into the cab she kept glancing about her in all directions,
as though aware that she was being watched.
As she drove off I noticed a man skulking in the doorway
of a store on the opposite side of the street. It
was that same dark-skinned, bearded chap who just
passed us. I saw him hurry across the street and rush
up to another taxi that was waiting at the cab stand.
I heard him instruct the driver to follow the woman’s
cab, no matter where it went. He spoke in English,
but with a decidedly foreign accent. My curiosity was
aroused, and I decided to see the thing out. I, too,
jumped into a taxi and joined in the procession.</p>

<p>“Straight down Fifth Avenue we went, as far as
Washington Square. Then the three of us turned into
a side street, and came to a stop. The woman’s cab
had halted outside the door of a dingy-looking house
in a neighborhood which had seen better days, but
which now consists mostly of cheap rooming houses.
The bearded man’s cab had drawn up about fifty yards
away. He jumped out quickly, and I alighted, too, as
inconspicuously as possible. A surprise awaited us
both. The first cab was empty. The woman had disappeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>Bates laughed knowingly. “She must have been
wise to the fact that she was being shadowed, and took
advantage of a chance to drop out somewhere along
the trail.”</p>

<p>“Of course. It’s an old trick. You ought to have
seen our bearded friend’s face when he found that he
had been fooled. He said a lot of things to himself
in Spanish. I have enough knowledge of that language
to know that his utterances weren’t fit for publication.
Wonder if he’s shadowing her again now.”</p>

<p>“Most likely,” said Bates. “I suppose he’s one of
Portiforo’s spies. Naturally, the present government
of Baracoa would be interested in the movements of
Señora Felix. I presume they hope, by watching her,
to get a line on where her husband is.”</p>

<p>“You think she knows that?”</p>

<p>“It is more than a bare possibility. Felix hasn’t
been heard of since he landed from his yacht on the
south coast of France two years ago, but it is exceedingly
likely that he has been in communication with
his wife. I understand they were a very devoted couple.
In fact, it was a surprise to everybody that when
he skipped he didn’t take her along. Well, here we
are at the White House grounds. See you later, old
man. I am burning up with curiosity to know what
the president wants of you.”</p>

<p>Bates’ curiosity in that respect was not destined to
be gratified that day, nor for many days after. When
the Camera Chap returned from his interview with
the president, and dropped in at the <cite>Sentinel</cite> bureau,
he was provokingly uncommunicative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“It was a fine lunch,” he said. “The White House
chef certainly knows his business; and the president
is a genial host. He is one of the most democratic
men I have ever met.”</p>

<p>“But what did you talk about?” Bates asked impatiently.
“I know very well that he didn’t send for you
merely to make your acquaintance. What did he want,
old man? You can trust me, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” the Camera Chap agreed cheerfully.
“We discussed many things—ranging all the
way from Park Row to South America.”</p>

<p>“South America!” the correspondent exclaimed
eagerly. “What did he have to say about that?”</p>

<p>Hawley’s eyes twinkled. “He asked me whether
I’d ever been out there, and when I told him no he expressed
great surprise, saying that I certainly ought
to make it a point to go; that he felt sure I would find
many interesting things to photograph in that part of
the world.”</p>

<p>Hearing which Bates had a shrewd suspicion that
the president had suggested some particularly interesting
thing to photograph in some part of South
America; but, although he was a past master in the
art of extracting information from unwilling lips, his
efforts failed to draw out the Camera Chap further
along this line.</p>

<p>It was the president’s closing remark to Hawley
which had compelled the latter to adopt this sphinx-like
attitude.</p>

<p>“I will not pledge you to secrecy,” the chief executive
had said. “I will merely urge you to be discreet,<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
Mr. Hawley. I think I am able to estimate a man at
first sight, and if I did not feel that you could be relied
upon I would not have asked you to undertake this
mission. You realize, of course, that in addition to
the risk you will be running, a human life may depend
upon your discretion.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">PAXTON’S WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Inasmuch as the president had not pledged him to
secrecy, the Camera Chap decided to take one person
into his confidence regarding his visit to the White
House. He knew that Tom Paxton, managing editor
of the <cite>Sentinel</cite>, could be trusted, and there were reasons
why Hawley felt that it was necessary to have
him know the purpose of the undertaking on which he
was about to embark. So he returned to New York
that night, and arrived at the <cite>Sentinel</cite> office just as
Paxton was closing down his desk with the intention
of going home.</p>

<p>“Back so soon!” The boyish-looking managing editor
greeted him, grinning. “I supposed it would take
you at least a couple of weeks to tell the president
all you know about how to run the ship of state. Seriously
speaking, though, old man, I’m glad you’ve returned.
I’ve got a little job for you up in Canada that
needs your immediate attention. It——”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Tom,” the Camera Chap interrupted,
“but I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to hand that assignment
to somebody else. I can’t touch it. I’ve got
to have a couple of months’ leave of absence—to begin
at once.”</p>

<p>Paxton looked his astonishment. “What are you
going to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I am going to South America,” Hawley announced.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
“To Baracoa, to be precise. I suppose you recall,
Tom, the sensational disappearance of President Felix,
a couple of years ago?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Paxton replied. He had a phenomenal
memory for contemporaneous history. It was the
boast of the <cite>Sentinel</cite> staff that he could give, offhand,
facts and figures of any event of importance in
any part of the world within the past ten years.</p>

<p>“Francisco Felix,” he went on, as though reading
from a book, “the poor Baracoa laborer who became
president. They called him ‘the South American
Abraham Lincoln.’ He was the idol of the people—the
most beloved and respected executive Baracoa has
ever had—until he proved himself to be a crook by
absconding with the contents of the national treasury.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled. “That is the story which
is generally accepted,” he said quietly. “But there is
a possibility that the world may have done President
Felix a great injustice.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Paxton asked, looking
searchingly in the other’s face.</p>

<p>“It now appears,” said the Camera Chap, “that instead
of being a fugitive and an absconder, Felix may
really have been the victim of a daring conspiracy;
that instead of being free in some part of Europe at
this moment, living in luxury on his loot, the unhappy
man is in reality eating out his heart in a South American
dungeon—where he has been ever since that fatal
night that he is supposed to have skipped from Baracoa
in his private yacht. In other words, Tom, it was all<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
a frame-up. According to this story, Felix was kidnaped
by the Portiforo party, who, realizing that he
was too strong with the people to be deposed by an
ordinary revolution, took this means of discrediting
him and seizing the reins of government.”</p>

<p>Editor Paxton smiled incredulously. “Sounds
pretty far-fetched. Yet I don’t know,” he added musingly.
“Almost anything is possible down in that part
of the continent; and I recall that there were some
circumstances about Felix’s disappearance which struck
me at the time as queer. There is the fact, for instance,
that he has never been seen since the day his
yacht reached the south coast of France.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t seen even then,” Hawley reminded him.
“At least, there is no proof that the man who came
ashore was really Felix. The only persons who saw
him were some French peasants, and, of course, they
wouldn’t know Felix by sight.”</p>

<p>“There was the crew of the yacht,” Paxton suggested.
“You are forgetting, perhaps, that later on
they were caught and they admitted the whole business.”</p>

<p>“It is possible that they were in the conspiracy,”
Hawley argued. “Every member of the crew could
have been a Portiforo agent, carefully instructed as
to the story he was to tell.”</p>

<p>The managing editor nodded. “Yes; that’s possible.
By George!” he added, a glint in his eyes,
“what a wonderful story—if it should be true. Where
on earth did you get hold of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“At the White House,” the Camera Chap replied,
sinking his voice almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>“What! You don’t mean to say the president believes
it?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. In fact, he is strongly inclined to
think that it is a preposterous theory concocted by
Portiforo’s enemies. Still, there is a doubt in his
mind. That is why I am going to Baracoa.”</p>

<p>“He is sending you there to investigate this yarn?”</p>

<p>“To find Felix, if he is really in Baracoa, and to
bring back a snapshot of him,” Hawley said simply.</p>

<p>“Good stuff!” Paxton approved. “If we had photographic
evidence the United States would be in a position
to intervene, and demand Felix’s immediate release.
That, of course, would mean the finish of Portiforo,
and I happen to know that there are reasons why
Washington wouldn’t be exactly sorry to see a change
in the government of Baracoa. But I say, old man,”
he added anxiously, “do you appreciate the magnitude
of the job you’re tackling? Do you realize the danger?”</p>

<p>“Surely I do,” Hawley answered. “The president
warned me that I would have to be very careful—that
if the story happened to be true, and Portiforo should
find out the object of my trip to Baracoa, the consequences
would be serious. They would probably seek
to remove the evidence—by murdering poor Felix before
I had a chance to get to him.”</p>

<p>Paxton frowned. “Yes, I have no doubt they would
do that. They would make short work of Felix. But
I wasn’t referring to him; I was thinking of what<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
might happen to you if they were to nab you in the
act of trying to get that snapshot.” His tone was very
grave. “I am afraid, old man, that they would stand
you up against a stone wall, with a handkerchief
around your eyes and spray you with lead from their
guns.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap laughed. “Not as bad as that, I
guess. A dungeon cell and a ball and chain would be
about the limit.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” Paxton muttered. “What protection
does the president promise you in case you are
caught?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t promise me any protection,” the Camera
Chap replied cheerfully. “On the contrary, he gave
me clearly to understand that I am going into this thing
at my own risk. He explained that if I am apprehended
in the act of violating any of the laws of a
friendly nation, the United States government
wouldn’t have any right to intervene.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” growled Paxton. “Why the deuce
couldn’t he have given this job to a secret-service man
instead of you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask him that,” Hawley answered, smiling.
“But don’t worry, Tom. I’m going to get along all
right. They’re not going to catch me, you know.”</p>

<p>The managing editor shook his head forebodingly.
“I’ve a good mind to refuse you that leave of absence,”
he said. “I’d do it, too, if I didn’t know that you’d
go, anyway—and if you were working for anybody
else but the President of the United States. When
do you expect to start?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“To-morrow. The <em>Colombia</em>, of the Andean line,
sails for South American waters at two p. m. I’ve
engaged passage on her.”</p>

<p>“You’re certainly not losing any time,” Paxton
chuckled. “Would you like me to send somebody along
to help you, old man? You can have the pick of our
staff.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap declined this offer. “I’m ever so
much obliged,” he said, “but I have decided that I had
better work alone. It seems to me that this is one of
those cases where one head will be better than two.”
He extended his hand. “Good-by, Tom. I’ll trot
along. I’ve got to go home and pack my trunk.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, old man,” said the managing editor, gripping
the outstretched hand with a fervor he rarely displayed.
“Good-by, and good-luck to you! You’ll need
all the luck you can command; for this is by far the
most dangerous job you’ve ever tackled. By the way,
let me give you a little tip that may prove valuable. If
you should happen to get into trouble, and have to
appeal to the American minister to save you, you’d
better not let him know, if you can help it, that you
are a member of the <cite>Sentinel</cite> staff.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I should think——”</p>

<p>“Minister Throgmorton doesn’t like the <cite>Sentinel</cite>,”
Paxton interrupted dryly. “He has good reason for
his prejudice. We have been roasting him editorially
ever since he was appointed. So, under the circumstances,
I scarcely think he would move heaven and
earth to help a <cite>Sentinel</cite> man.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">SEÑORA FELIX.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Andean line steamship <em>Colombia</em> was about to
weigh anchor when the Camera Chap came aboard.
He was not the only passenger who narrowly missed
being left behind. As his taxicab drew up at the
wharf two women were just alighting from an electric
brougham. One of them was a blonde, and the other
a pronounced brunette. Hawley gave a start of surprise
at sight of them.</p>

<p>“Bon voyage, dear,” the blond woman was saying.
“I trust that everything will come out all right,
and that you will soon be back in Washington. After
all, your father’s condition may not be as serious as
the telegram makes out. You know how doctors sometimes
exaggerate.”</p>

<p>The dark woman smiled faintly. “I pray that it
may be so,” she said; “but I am greatly worried. They
would not have sent for me unless it was very serious.
Au revoir, and thank you a thousand times for all your
kindnesses.”</p>

<p>“All aboard, ladies!” the officer at the gangplank
cried. “Please hurry.”</p>

<p>The women embraced, and the blonde, whom Hawley
had recognized as the wife of the United States
attorney general, reëntered the brougham. The other
hurried up the gangplank, the Camera Chap following
close behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Señora Felix!” he said to himself. “I didn’t expect
to have her for a fellow passenger. Lucky, I
guess, that I decided to take this boat.”</p>

<p>On board the señora was greeted by a younger
woman, whom she addressed as Celeste, and who,
Hawley learned later, was her maid. They went immediately
to her stateroom.</p>

<p>Hawley soon learned that Señora Felix’s departure
from the United States was no secret. He had brought
an evening newspaper on board, and on an inside page
he came across the following heading, so inconspicuously
displayed that it had first escaped his notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fugitive President’s Wife Goes Back.—Victoria
Felix, ‘Grass Widow’ of Baracoa’s Missing Chief
Executive, Sails To-day for Her Native Land
After Two Years’ Exile in Washington.—Serious
Illness of Her Father Given as Cause of
Trip.”</p>
</div>

<p>From the quarter of a column of smaller type which
appeared beneath this heading he learned that Señora
Felix’s father was Doctor Emilio Hernandez, a prominent
physician of San Cristobal, the capital of Baracoa.
He had been seized with a paralytic stroke, and his
daughter had been hurriedly summoned.</p>

<p>It was not until the vessel was well out at sea that
the Camera Chap saw the señora again. She did not
appear in the dining saloon for the evening meal, nor
did she show herself on deck during the first day of
the voyage. He inquired of one of the stewards, and
learned that she was indisposed. But on the second
day he saw her reclining in a steamer chair on the<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
promenade deck, apparently absorbed in the pages
of a French novel. He stood with his back against the
starboard rail at a sufficient distance from her chair to
avoid making his attention too marked, and covertly
studied her.</p>

<p>She was slender, dark-eyed, about forty, and of
aristocratic bearing. She was still beautiful, although
suffering had imprinted deep lines on her olive skin.
The set of her chin and the shape of her delicate mouth
denoted character; in that respect the young man who
was so intently watching her felt that he had never
seen a face which impressed him more favorably. He
recalled what Bates had said about the probability of
her knowing the whereabouts of her fugitive husband,
and he decided that the Washington correspondent
must be wrong about that.</p>

<p>“If Felix isn’t the martyr I believe him to be—if his
disappearance was voluntary, that woman was not a
party to it, either before or afterward,” he told himself
confidently. “A woman with a face like hers
wouldn’t shield a crook, even if he was her husband.
I take her to be the kind that would go through fire
for a man worthy of her love, but a woman who
wouldn’t have a particle of use for a moral weakling.”</p>

<p>As he was thus soliloquizing, the subject of his
thoughts looked up from her book, and their eyes met.
A faint tinge of pink made itself visible beneath her
dark skin, as though she were embarrassed by his
scrutiny. She frowned slightly; then resumed her
reading.</p>

<p>Feeling that he owed her an apology for his seeming<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
rudeness, Hawley was debating in his mind
whether it would be discreet to take her into his confidence
as to his mission to Baracoa, when an incident
occurred which diverted his attention. Two men
strolling along the promenade deck suddenly halted a
short distance from where the señora was sitting, and
stood leaning with their elbows resting on the rail.
Hawley recognized both of these men. One of them,
in fact, occupied the stateroom opposite his own. He
was a clean-shaven, swarthy man of middle age, who
was down on the passenger list as Señor José Lopez.
The first time he had seen him on the boat it had struck
Hawley that there was something familiar about the
fellow’s face, but so far he had cudgeled his brain in
an effort to recall when and where he had seen him
before.</p>

<p>The other man was of striking appearance. He was
tall, and of soldierly carriage. His dark, curly hair
was gray at the temples, but, apart from this evidence
of years, his handsome face was so youthful looking
that he could easily have passed for a man in the early
thirties. His complexion was ruddy, his dark eyes
were sparkling. His well-waxed mustache, the ends
of which were as sharp as stiletto points, gave his
countenance a decidedly foreign aspect, otherwise he
might have been taken for an American. The Camera
Chap had learned that his name was Juan Cipriani,
that he was a native of Argentine, and on his way back
to that country.</p>

<p>The pair had been engaged in conversation as they
approached, and now, as they leaned against the rail,<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
they continued talking. They spoke in Spanish, and
it seemed to Hawley that their voices were pitched
above their normal register.</p>

<p>“In my opinion, it is a piece of impertinence for her
to return to Baracoa,” the one known as Cipriani said
emphatically. “If she has any delicacy she must
realize how unwelcome she will be to the people whom
her rascally husband robbed and betrayed.”</p>

<p>“But if her father is dying,” the other argued
tolerantly.</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Cipriani, with a contemptuous gesture.
“Who would believe that story? You can depend
upon it, my friend, her sole purpose in going
back there is to make trouble. If your President
Portiforo were wise he would instruct his port officers
to refuse to permit her to leave the ship. That is the
only way to deal with a woman of her stripe.”</p>

<p>“But, after all, it is scarcely fair to blame her for
her husband’s sins,” Lopez suggested mildly. “We
must admit that the abominable Felix treated her as
shabbily as he did my unfortunate country. I understand
that she has not once heard from him since he
fled.”</p>

<p>The other laughed ironically. “Are you so ingenuous,
my friend, as to believe that? You can be
sure that he has been in constant communication with
her, and that she is only waiting for a chance to join
him and help him spend his stolen fortune. No doubt,
she would have done so before now if she had not
feared that she was too closely watched to—— I
beg your pardon, sir—what did you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>This last remark was addressed to the Camera Chap,
who, unable to contain himself any longer, had stepped
up, frowning angrily, a menacing glint in his eyes.
He knew Spanish well enough to make out most of
their conversation, and although he had stood some
distance away, every word that they had uttered had
reached his ears. He knew, too, that the señora
had heard. She was making a brave pretense of
being absorbed in her novel, but the book trembled
perceptibly in her hand. Up to this point Hawley had
hesitated to interfere, feeling that such a course might
only add to her embarrassment; but now he decided
that this cruelty must be stopped. If these men were
permitted to go on there was no telling what they
might say next.</p>

<p>“I say that your conversation is offensive,” he repeated
quietly, but with emphasis. “I ask you to stop
it immediately.”</p>

<p>He spoke in English, and Cipriani answered him in
that language, which he spoke fluently, although with
a marked accent. “It seems to me that you are impertinent,
sir,” the latter said, his dark eyes flashing.
“Might I inquire in what way our conversation could
possibly be offensive to you?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap lowered his voice. “Don’t you
realize that every word you are saying is being heard
by Señora Felix? What kind of men are you, any
way, to insult a woman like this? I thought you
South Americans boasted of your chivalry.”</p>

<p>Señor Cipriani glanced toward the woman in the
steamer chair. Suddenly she rose and walked away<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
with dignity. A look of astonishment came in Cipriani’s
face. “Señora Felix!” he repeated. “My dear
sir, you don’t mean to tell me that is she?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Didn’t you know it?”</p>

<p>Cipriani shook his head. “How unfortunate!” he
murmured, and if the regret in his tone was feigned, it
was skillfully done. “I assure you, sir, that I would
rather have had my tongue cut out than intentionally
make such remarks in the presence of the lady. I
would apologize to her most abjectly, but I fear that
would only be making matters worse. You see, I’ve
never met the señora—this is the first time I have
seen her since she came aboard.” Then, seized with
a sudden thought, he turned upon Lopez, his face
flaming with rage. “But you must have known her!”
he declared hotly. “It is not possible that you did
not recognize the wife of your former president.
Why did you let me go ahead? Why did you not
warn me of what I was doing?”</p>

<p>The clean-shaven, swarthy man shrugged his shoulders.
“I did not notice that the señora was sitting
there,” he said deprecatingly. “I was so engrossed
in your interesting remarks that I did not observe our
surroundings.” As he spoke he smiled—an expansive
grin which bared his large, exceedingly white teeth,
which somehow reminded the Camera Chap of the
fangs of a wolf.</p>

<p>“Now, where the deuce have I seen that man?”
Hawley asked himself. “The more I see of him, the
more I feel that we met before we came aboard, but
to save my life I can’t place him.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">BOLD CURIOSITY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Muttering an apology, Lopez walked away, and as
he strode rapidly across the deck toward the companionway,
the Camera Chap noted curiously that his
footsteps were uncannily noiseless. Cipriani, too,
seemed to observe that fact, for he remarked, with
a smile: “Our friend certainly is most appropriately
named. Does not his walk suggest to you the lope
of a wolf?”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I was thinking,” said the Camera
Chap. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“His name is José Lopez, and he hails from Baracoa.
That is all I can tell you about him. I have just made
his acquaintance. We got to talking about his country,
and that is how we came to discuss Señora Felix.
I wish I could express to you how deeply I regret
that I so cruelly hurt her feelings. If you are acquainted
with the lady and——”</p>

<p>“I am not,” Hawley hastily interrupted. “I merely
know her by sight. She was pointed out to me the
other day in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You are from Washington?” It seemed to
the Camera Chap that the other looked at him very
keenly.</p>

<p>“Not guilty,” he said, with a laugh. “New York
is my stamping ground. I merely happened to be in
Washington for a couple of days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“I see. And you are now bound for——” Cipriani
paused interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I am going as far as Puerto Cabero.”</p>

<p>Once more the other looked at him searchingly.
“Might I inquire the object of your visit to Baracoa,
if the question is not too personal?”</p>

<p>Hawley smiled. “I haven’t any great objection to
answering it,” he said. “I am an artist, and I am
going to make some pictures. I understand that the
landscapes there are very fine.”</p>

<p>“An artist,” the other exclaimed. “That is interesting.
I should very much like to see some of your
work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some day I will show you,” said the
Camera Chap, his eyes twinkling. “And now, having
answered your question, may I ask you one in return?”</p>

<p>“I am at your service, señor.”</p>

<p>“I would like to know why you are so bitterly
prejudiced against Señora Felix. She doesn’t strike
me as being the sort of woman who deserves the unkind
things you said about her.”</p>

<p>Cipriani shrugged his shoulders. “You are young,
my friend. When you have lived as long as I you
will not judge by appearances,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t answering my question,” Hawley
insisted. “Have you any special reason for believing
that the señora knows where her husband is?”</p>

<p>“Only my knowledge of human nature,” Cipriani
replied. “As I said before, it is only logical to suppose
that Felix has communicated with his wife since<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
he ran away. I understand that they were a most
devoted couple. I presume that when he fled they
had an understanding that she was to join him later
on; probably she has found it impossible to do so
because of the close watch that Portiforo has kept
on her.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that Portiforo has been keeping
a close watch on her?” Hawley asked quickly.</p>

<p>Cipriani seemed discomfited by the question. He
winced, and his ruddy face changed color; but his
confusion quickly passed. “Of course, I do not know
it,” he said suavely. “I only assume it. Is it not
logical to suppose that the government of Baracoa
would keep the wife of an absconding president under
close surveillance? If you had ever lived in South
America you would not have asked that question.
There are more spies down there than there are people
to spy on.”</p>

<p>He threw the stub of his cigarette into the sea, and
took a gold case from his pocket to supply himself
with another. “May I offer you one of these?” he
said. “They are of my own manufacture. I am in
the cigarette business in Buenos Aires.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Hawley. “I prefer a pipe.”
He felt in his pocket. “That reminds me; I left my
brier in my stateroom. I’ll go and get it. See you
again, sir.”</p>

<p>The South American smiled and bowed, but as the
Camera Chap walked away the smile abruptly left his
face, and was replaced by an anxious expression.
“We must find out more about that interesting young<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
man,” he mused. “I don’t think he is going to Baracoa
to paint landscapes.”</p>

<p>When Hawley reached his stateroom he made a disconcerting
discovery. The room had been entered
since he was there last, and somebody had been
through his baggage. He knew that such was the
case because certain articles were not as he had left
them. Nothing was missing—a close inventory of
his effects satisfied him as to that; but the contents
of his trunk and his suit case were slightly disarranged.</p>

<p>With a frown he stepped out into the corridor, and
went in search of the steward. “Didn’t happen to
see anybody go in or out of my room during the last
two hours, did you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The man looked worried. “No, sir; I—I didn’t
actually see anybody—go in or out,” he stammered.
“But, now that you speak of it, I saw something that
was rather queer.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“As I was passing your door, ten minutes ago, I
saw a man fumbling with the lock. It looked to me
as if he was just locking the door; but when I stepped
up to him he explained that he had made a mistake,
and was trying to get in, thinking it was his own
room.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Hawley exclaimed. “Do you know who
he was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it was the gentleman who occupies the
room across the hall from yours—Señor José Lopez.”</p>

<p>“The deuce!” muttered Hawley. “No wonder he<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
has such a catlike tread. Evidently he needs it in his
business. Begins to look as if he might be one of
Portiforo’s spies sent—— By Jove! I’ve got the
answer, now, as to where I’ve seen his face. What
a chump I am not to have remembered before. It
was the absence of his whiskers that fooled me. His
appearance is considerably changed without them, but
I’m quite sure, now, that he’s the same busybody who
was trailing Señora Felix in a taxicab.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A MEETING AFTER DARK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If the Camera Chap had witnessed a meeting which
took place that night between Señora Felix and a certain
tall, soldierly-looking male passenger, and if he
could have overheard their conversation, he would
have been greatly amazed and perplexed.</p>

<p>It was well on toward midnight. The musicians
had long ago ceased playing, and most of the passengers
had turned in. The promenade deck was as
deserted as Broadway after four a. m. The señora,
as she stood at the rail, pensively watching the moonbeams
playing upon the waves, was as motionless
as a wax figure. She was wrapped in a long, black
silk shawl so arranged about her head that most of
her face was hidden, but the tall, soldierly-looking
man who stepped up to her had no difficulty in recognizing
her.</p>

<p>She turned swiftly at the sound of his footfall
behind her, and an exclamation of pleasure escaped
her lips. “So you managed it all right!” she whispered
in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Yes, señora; but it is very unwise. I got your
message, and I felt that I had to obey this time—but
it must not occur again. The risk is too great.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she acquiesced. “As you say, it must
not occur again. From now on we must be as
strangers; but I felt that I must have this one talk
with you. I am so very anxious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>A frown darkened his handsome features. “It is
exceedingly unfortunate, señora, that you should have
sailed on this boat,” he said ungraciously. “Your
presence here is likely to prove disastrous. If only
you had waited for another week.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” she answered deprecatingly. “They
sent me word that my father’s condition was most
serious, and I felt it my duty to go to him at once.
But I had no idea that you would be here. I understood
that you were to sail next Tuesday on the
<em>Panama</em>.”</p>

<p>“Such was my original intention,” he answered;
“but there were good reasons why I had to alter my
plans. I certainly would have delayed my sailing,
however, if I had suspected that there was the slightest
chance of your being here. I greatly fear the fact
that we are traveling on the same boat is regarded
as more than a mere coincidence by our friend who
calls himself José Lopez.”</p>

<p>A worried expression came to the señora’s face.
“How much does he know?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“I would give much to be able to answer that question,”
her companion replied, with a grim smile. “Of
this much I am sure, however: He already has a
strong suspicion that my name is not Juan Cipriani,
and that my destination is not Buenos Aires. He
forced his acquaintanceship upon me in the smoking
room to-day, and began straightway to cross-examine
me in a manner which, no doubt, he considered adroit,
but which I saw through immediately. In an attempt
to lull his suspicion I went through that painful little<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
scene in front of you. I need scarcely assure you,
señora, of my profound regret at being obliged to hurt
your feelings so cruelly.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” she answered. “I realized the
necessity. You managed it very skillfully. I feel
sure that he must have been convinced that you were
unacquainted with me, and that we have no interest
in common.”</p>

<p>“I am not so certain of that,” the man answered,
shaking his head. “The best that we can hope is
that I succeeded in establishing a doubt in his mind;
but I fear that he guessed it was all a trick contrived
to deceive him. For the rest of this voyage, I am
afraid, he will be watching us closely—on the alert
for the slightest glance that passes between us. You
must be very careful, señora.”</p>

<p>“I will,” she promised. “Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“Asleep in his stateroom. I made sure of that before
I came here to keep this appointment.” The
man paused. “But it is not him alone we have cause
to fear,” he exclaimed suddenly. “There is somebody
else on board whose presence is a grave menace
to us. That good-looking young American who so
impulsively came to your rescue this afternoon—do
you know who he is?”</p>

<p>The señora shook her head. “That was one of the
reasons I felt it necessary to have this talk with you.
I, too, am uneasy about that young man. In spite
of his interference in my behalf this afternoon, I have
reason to suspect that he belongs to our enemies.”</p>

<p>Her companion frowned. “Would you mind telling<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
me your reasons for thinking that, señora?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“The first time I noticed him was in New York,
several days ago,” the woman explained. “It was
that day I visited your headquarters. You remember
my telling you that I had been followed?”</p>

<p>The man nodded. “That was the time you worked
that clever trick with the taxicab,” he said, with a
smile. “But I understood you to say that it was
Lopez who was shadowing you?”</p>

<p>“There were two of them. Lopez was in one cab,
but there was another taxi behind his. It contained
that young American. I had previously noticed him
watching me as I came out of the Mammoth.”</p>

<p>Her companion uttered a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>“And that wasn’t the only time,” the señora went
on. “I saw him in Washington, the day before he
sailed. I was driving in Pennsylvania Avenue, and
I noticed him on the sidewalk. That may have been
a coincidence, of course, but I am afraid not. I noticed
that he was observing me very closely. And then,
again, he came on board this ship at exactly the same
time I did. He was close behind me as I walked up
the gangplank. All of which leads me to believe that
he is on this vessel for the purpose of spying upon
us. I have had Celeste make inquiries about him,
and she has learned that he is a New Yorker named
Hawley. He claims to be an artist on his way to
Baracoa to paint some landscapes, but I am sure that
that is only a bluff. The man is one of Portiforo’s
spies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p>Her companion smiled. “You are mistaken about
that, señora. I, too, have been making inquiries about
this young man. I was fortunate enough to get hold
of a fellow passenger, an American, who could tell
me all about him. He is not connected with Portiforo—but
he is just as dangerous to us as if such were
the case.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” the señora asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Hawley is his right name, and, as he has said,
he is an artist. But he does not wield a brush. He
makes his pictures with a camera. He is a newspaper
photographer—on the staff of the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite>.”</p>

<p>The señora gave vent to a faint cry. “Hawley, of
the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite>!” she exclaimed agitatedly.
“I have heard of him. He is that wonderful photographer
they call the Camera Chap.”</p>

<p>Her companion nodded. “I see that you realize,
señora, how careful we must be of him. The press
is as much to be feared by us as our enemies in
Baracoa. If a Yankee newspaper were to get hold
of our secret we should be lost. I don’t know what
he is after, but I shall——”</p>

<p>“I do,” the señora interrupted tensely. “Now that
I know who that young man is, I understand fully
why he is going to Baracoa. And he must be stopped,”
she added, her voice vibrant with emotion. “He must
not be permitted to go ahead. We must find some
way of preventing it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">DISCOURAGING NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not until the <em>Colombia</em> was approaching
Puerto Guerra, the first port of call in Baracoa, that
the Camera Chap exchanged a single word with Señora
Felix. Possibly he could have conversed with her
before that had he desired to do so, for she spent
much time on deck, and on several occasions, as he
passed her steamer chair, he caught her dark eyes
regarding him with keen interest. Several incidents
arose, too, which seemed to offer him an opportunity
to make her acquaintance, and, modest young man
though he was, he could not help suspecting that these
incidents were arranged by her in an effort to bring
about that result.</p>

<p>Once, for instance, as he walked past where she
sat, she dropped the magazine she was reading, and
it seemed to Hawley that it was done somewhat ostentatiously,
as though she fully expected him to pick
it up. On another occasion her shawl fell from her
shoulders to the deck as she was promenading, when
Hawley was standing near by, and once more it
seemed to him that the act was done deliberately.</p>

<p>But even at the sacrifice of having to appear boorish,
he ignored these and other advances—if they
were advances—for although, under other circumstances,
he would have been delighted to make the
fair señora’s acquaintance, he had decided that it<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
would be most indiscreet to do so now. He had made
up his mind to keep away from her throughout the
entire trip.</p>

<p>It was the mysterious, soft-treading passenger
known as Señor José Lopez who was responsible for
this decision on his part. There was no doubt now
in Hawley’s mind that the fellow was a spy, a secret
agent of the Portiforo government, and such being
the case he deemed it highly necessary to keep Lopez
from guessing that there was aught in common between
himself and the wife of the missing president
of Baracoa. The slightest evidence of friendship between
himself and the woman, he surmised, might
give the spy cause to suspect the real object of his
mission to South America.</p>

<p>But one evening, as the vessel was approaching the
hilly coast line of Baracoa, a steward handed him a
note. The missive was in a woman’s handwriting, and
although it bore no signature he guessed at once from
whom it had come. It was short—merely a couple
of lines stating that the writer would appreciate it
very much if Mr. Hawley would make it a point to
be on the promenade deck after eleven o’clock that
night.</p>

<p>Guessing whom he would meet there if he kept this
appointment, the Camera Chap’s first thought was to
ignore the summons. But upon reflection, he changed
his mind. “It would be a pretty shabby way to act,”
he told himself. “Besides, I’m too curious to know
what she wants of me to be able to resist the temptation.
I’ll take a chance—provided I can dodge that<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
infernal busybody with the gumshoes. I’m afraid I
can’t afford to keep the appointment if he’s going to
be there. However, I think I’ll be able to get rid
of him.”</p>

<p>That evening most of the passengers retired unusually
early. The <em>Colombia</em> was to dock at sunrise
the following morning, and everybody, even those
who were not going ashore, desired to be awake early
to get the first sight of land. At nine-thirty, as the
orchestra finished its final selections, Hawley exchanged
“Good night” with several of his acquaintances,
and went to his stateroom. A few minutes
later, Señor José Lopez came down the corridor with
his noiseless, catlike tread, and stood listening intently
outside the Camera Chap’s door.</p>

<p>The latter grinned as he heard the eavesdropper’s
soft breathing. He was aware of the fact that his
neighbor across the hall paid him this attention each
night, never going to bed until he had made sure that
Hawley had retired. That cautious young man now
went through the formality of disrobing. Señor Lopez
heard the thud of his shoes as he allowed them to
drop noisily to the floor. Shortly afterward there was
the click of the electric light being switched off, and
soon after that a sound like a buzz saw in action satisfied
the eavesdropper that the occupant of the room
was well settled in the land of dreams. Then Lopez
stole across the corridor to his own stateroom, and
turned in with an easy mind.</p>

<p>A little more than an hour later the Camera Chap
arose, dressed himself in the dark, and, with his feet<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
incased in a pair of tennis shoes, emerged from his
stateroom, and moved along the corridor with a
secrecy which would have done credit to Lopez himself.</p>

<p>When he reached the promenade deck and strode
past the long row of empty chairs, there was not a
person to be seen. He was beginning to wonder if
he were not the victim of a practical joke, when suddenly
he espied a shrouded figure, which looked almost
ghostly in the moonlight, coming toward him.
With a cautious glance behind him, he stepped forward
to meet her.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you to come,” the woman
said softly. “But I knew that you would—just as I
feel confident that you will grant me the favor that
I am going to ask of you.” As she spoke she drew
aside the silken, fringed mantilla which concealed all
of her face except her eyes, but even before she did
this the Camera Chap knew with whom he was talking.</p>

<p>“If there is any service I can render you, señora,
you have only to name it,” he avowed impulsively.
And he meant it, for as he gazed into her dark, sad
eyes all the chivalry in him was stirred, and he thrilled
with pity for this frail, unhappy woman. At that moment
he would have been prepared to go to the rescue
of her husband with a sword instead of a camera if
more could have been gained that way.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say that,” Señora Felix
said gratefully. “I trust that you will not change
your mind, Mr. Hawley, when I tell you that the<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
favor I am going to ask of you concerns the errand
which has brought you to Baracoa.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap gave a start of surprise. “Then
you know——” he began excitedly, but suddenly on
his guard, abruptly checked himself. “The errand
which has brought me to Baracoa!” he exclaimed, with
well-feigned bewilderment. “I beg your pardon,
señora; I’m afraid I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>The woman laughed softly. “You can be quite
frank with me,” she said. “I know who has sent
you to Baracoa, and what you expect to find—in the
fortress of El Torro.” She paused, and an anxious
expression flitted across her face. “And the favor
I’m going to ask of you, Mr. Hawley, is—to give up
this undertaking.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap stared at her in astonishment.
“To give it up!” he exclaimed incredulously. “Surely
you can’t mean that, señora! If you really know
who sent me and what I hope to accomplish, it seems
to me you are the last person in the world who should
make such a request of me.”</p>

<p>The woman sighed. “There is a good reason for
what I ask. You would be running a great risk,
and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about the risk, señora,” the Camera
Chap interrupted cheerfully. “If that’s your only
reason for asking me to quit, I’m afraid I’ll have to
refuse to listen to you.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the only reason,” she rejoined. “If there
was anything to be gained by it, I’m afraid I would<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
be selfish enough to let you go ahead in spite of the
danger you would incur; but when I know that you
have come on a wild-goose chase, I feel it my duty to
prevent you from sacrificing yourself.”</p>

<p>“A wild-goose chase!” the Camera Chap repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes; for your president is misinformed,” the
señora declared tensely. “My husband is not confined
in El Torro. He is not in Baracoa. There is
no truth in the rumor which has brought you here.”</p>

<p>It was almost as if she had struck Hawley a physical
blow. Although, of course, he had realized all along
that there was a possibility of the story turning out
to be baseless, and although the president had intimated
that he himself placed no stock in the sensational
rumor, and was merely sending Hawley to
Baracoa in order to remove the last possible doubt
from his mind, somehow the Camera Chap had been
confident until that moment that he was embarked on
no fruitless mission. Instinctively he had felt that
Felix was a martyr instead of the rogue which the
world believed him. But now this statement, coming
from the missing man’s wife, seemed to dispel all
hope that such was the case.</p>

<p>“Do you know where he is, señora?” he inquired,
his disappointment evident in his voice.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated, and he caught the shade
which flitted across her face. “I do,” she said at
length, almost in a whisper. “He is—in Europe.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure, señora? Is it not possible
that you, too, have been deceived?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>She shook her head. “No; that is not possible—for
I have been in constant communication with him.
I received a letter from him only last week.” She
smiled sadly. “So you see, Mr. Hawley, there is
nothing for you to do.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE LOST CAUSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Camera Chap was noted on Park Row, among
other things, for the buoyancy of his nature and his
refusal to permit disappointments and setbacks to
ruffle him. But he was scarcely in a cheerful frame
of mind as he took his leave of Señora Felix and
went back to his stateroom. To have traveled several
thousand miles only to discover that he had come on
a fool’s errand, and, what was worse, to have had all
his dreams shattered, was a severe strain even for
his abundant stock of philosophy.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat on the edge of his berth,
meditating on his conversation with the wife of the
missing president. One thing puzzled him exceedingly:
Why had the woman taken him into her confidence
to the extent of telling him that she knew the
whereabouts of her husband? Why was she so keen
to dissuade him from persisting in his undertaking?
He took no stock in her assertion that solicitude for
his welfare had caused her to take this step. Surely,
he told himself, she would not have jeopardized her
husband’s safety and confessed herself an accessory
to a crime merely to save a stranger from getting
into trouble. There must be some more weighty
reason which had prompted her to intrust him with
her secret.</p>

<p>Suddenly his face lighted up, and he gave vent to<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
a joyous ejaculation. “Of course, that must be it,”
he muttered. “The poor little señora! I hate to doubt
the word of a lady, but I’m afraid I’ll have to take
your statements with a grain of salt.”</p>

<p>His mind more at ease now, he climbed into his
berth, and was soon in a sound sleep. He was awakened
early in the morning by the voice of the steward
in the corridor notifying those passengers whose destination
was Puerto Guerra that their port had been
sighted.</p>

<p>Hawley hurried into his clothes and went on deck.
He was not going to disembark at that point; he had
decided to land at Puerto Cabero, farther on along
the coast of Baracoa, and only a few miles from
the capital. Yet he was anxious to get his first sight
of the land which was to be the scene of his activities.</p>

<p>The ship was picking her way through the coral
reefs as he walked to the bow, and stood gazing with
interest at the palm-fringed harbor. There he was
soon joined by other passengers, among them Señora
Felix. She was not going ashore at this port; like
Hawley, she was booked to land at Puerto Cabero,
but she had left instructions to be awakened as soon
as land was sighted, and she now stood against the
rail, a pathetically wistful expression on her sad
countenance as she stared at the blue-black mountains
which formed a background to the quiet little village
of thatched houses.</p>

<p>There was only one pier in the harbor. It projected
from a low stone structure which, the Camera
Chap overheard somebody say, was the custom house.<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
A handful of swarthy-faced men in blue uniforms
stood on the pier, languidly watching the approach of
the steamship. When the <em>Colombia</em> had docked and
began to unload freight, these men gathered around
six huge packing cases which were carried ashore,
and studied them with great interest.</p>

<p>A fat official whose blue uniform was decorated
with much gold lace gave some orders to two of the
men, who grinned and began to pry off the lid of one
of these packing cases. As she watched this act from
the deck of the ship an involuntary exclamation escaped
Señora Felix. It was only a slight murmur, but
it reached the ears of the Camera Chap, who was
standing near by. He glanced at her, and observed
that her hands were gripping the top of the rail so
hard that the knuckles showed white through the nut-brown
skin. Evidently she was under a great nervous
strain.</p>

<p>Abruptly his attention was drawn from the woman
at his side to what was taking place on shore. A
force of men on horseback, fifty strong, had galloped
up to the group of soldiers gathered around the packing
cases. The newcomers were wild-looking fellows,
raggedly dressed, and all of them armed. They uttered
loud cries as they surrounded the handful of soldiers,
who promptly threw up their hands in surrender.</p>

<p>Astonished as the Camera Chap was by this spectacle,
he presently witnessed something which amazed
him still more. A man rushed from the ship to the
pier, and as he went down the gangplank he was
greeted by cheers from the wild-looking horsemen.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
The man was the tall, handsome passenger whom
Hawley had known at Señor Juan Cipriani, of Buenos
Aires. He was clad now in a gorgeous uniform of
blue and gold, and he brandished a sword which flashed
in the sunlight. As he joined the group on the pier
they gathered around him, and welcomed him with
shouts of “Viva Rodriguez! Viva el general!” He
acknowledged this ovation with a graceful sweep of
his sombrero, and as he happened to turn toward the
ship, Hawley saw that his face was aglow with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Something caused the Camera Chap to glance, just
then, at Señora Felix. A great change had come over
her. Her face, too, was radiant with happiness, and
she was sobbing softly.</p>

<p>But suddenly she uttered a cry of mingled horror
and dismay; she clutched the rail in front of her, as
though to save herself from falling. The Camera
Chap had only to glance toward the dock to realize
the cause of her agitation. With the swiftness of a
moving-picture drama, the scene there had changed.
A regiment of infantry, springing up apparently from
nowhere, had surrounded the group of horsemen. The
latter were now surrendering as meekly as the handful
of soldiers had previously surrendered to them. The
only man making the slightest attempt to fight was
Cipriani. He was struggling frantically in the grasp
of two burly infantrymen.</p>

<p>These two successive bloodless victories struck
Hawley as so ludicrous that he would have laughed
but for the evident grief of the woman beside him.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
There was not the slightest doubt that this latest
development meant tragedy to her, however amusing
it might appear to a disinterested spectator. Making
a valiant effort to regain her calm, she hurried below
to her stateroom.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap did not see her again until the
<em>Colombia</em> arrived at Puerto Cabero. But before they
arrived at the latter port a steward stealthily handed
him at note. The missive was unsigned, but he recognized
the handwriting, and although to anybody
else its wording might have been vague, he had no
difficulty in grasping its meaning. The note ran:</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to what was said to you last
night. What you have witnessed has changed the
situation. Now, our only hope lies in your discretion
and your ability to carry out the mission intrusted to
you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE GIRL IN PINK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As the <em>Colombia</em> steamed into the harbor of Puerto
Cabero the following day, the Camera Chap caught
sight of a turreted, forbidding-looking gray edifice
on the east shore, and he did not have to make inquiries
in order to know what this building was.
Although he had never seen it before, he knew that
he was gazing on the fortress of El Torro, which,
in addition to being the main defense of Baracoa’s
chief seaport, was also internationally famous as the
living tomb of several ill-starred wretches whose
political activities had earned for them the grim decoration
of the ball and chain.</p>

<p>According to the rumor which had brought Hawley
to South America, it was within this building that
Portiforo had the unhappy Felix locked up; therefore
the Camera Chap viewed it with more than idle interest.
As he noted the sentries marching to and fro
in front of the gray walls it impressed him as being
“a pretty formidable sort of a joint,” and he didn’t
imagine that it was going to be exactly a picnic to
get inside of it.</p>

<p>“I observe that the señor is interested in El Torro,”
exclaimed a voice close behind him. “It is a place
much easier to enter than it is to leave.”</p>

<p>Coming as though in response to his unspoken
thought, the words startled Hawley. He wheeled<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
swiftly, and found himself gazing into the swarthy
countenance of Señor José Lopez.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that remark?” he demanded
sharply. Then, suddenly on his guard, he added more
mildly: “What makes you think that I am particularly
interested in El Torro?”</p>

<p>The other bared his large teeth in a wolflike grin.
“I judged that such was the case from the manner
in which the señor was staring at it,” he replied
quietly.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap laughed. “It is a picturesque
pile,” he declared. “From an artistic standpoint it
appeals to me greatly. I certainly will have to make
a picture of it before I return to the United States.
That is, of course, if it isn’t against the rules.”</p>

<p>Lopez shrugged his shoulders. “I dare say there
will be no objection to Señor Hawley making as many
pictures as he desires—of the outside of El Torro,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder what the deuce he meant by that!”
Hawley reflected, as the other walked away. “I’d
give a lot to know whether that confounded spy suspects
anything.”</p>

<p>Until that moment he had felt confident that he
had his inquisitive fellow passenger guessing as to
the object of his visit to Baracoa, but the significant
remark which the latter had just let drop made him
exceedingly uneasy. There being no doubt in his mind
that Lopez was a secret agent of the Portiforo government,
he feared that he was going to have a hard
time losing him when they got ashore; in fact, he<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
was now even prepared to be challenged by the immigration
authorities, and told that his presence in
Baracoa was not desired. But, greatly to his relief,
both these fears proved unfounded. When the vessel
docked, the pier authorities manifested no more interest
in him than in any of the other passengers; on
the contrary, the customs officers were so careless in
their examination of his baggage that they did not
even discover the big camera in his trunk. And when
he went ashore, Lopez made no attempt to shadow
him; in fact, he saw the latter board a train without
even a glance in his direction.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which surprised him somewhat
was that Señora Felix was also permitted to land
without undue attention from the authorities. In view
of what had happened at Puerto Guerra, and her obvious
interest therein, he had been wondering ever
since whether she would not be placed under arrest
as soon as she attempted to land, on a charge of being
in some way connected with the affair, and he was
very glad to find that such was not the case.</p>

<p>Hawley watched the landing of the señora with
great interest. He observed that as she and her maid
stepped from the pier, many people stared at her,
recognizing her as the wife of their missing president;
but nobody spoke to her, with the exception of a blond-haired,
blue-eyed girl in a pink dress, who stepped
up and greeted her effusively.</p>

<p>This young woman aroused the Camera Chap’s
curiosity. It was quite evident that she was not a
native of Baracoa; at first sight he would have been<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
willing to bet all the money he had in his pocket that
she was of his own people. She appeared to be still
in her “teens,” and was of such an attractive personality
that almost any one would have bestowed
more than one glance upon her, even if his interest
had not been intensified by the fact that she was there
to welcome Señora Felix.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two women stood chatting
together in the plaza in front of the steamship pier,
Celeste, the señora’s maid, hanging respectfully in
the background. Then, followed by the latter, they
made their way toward a touring car standing near
by, which they entered. The girl in pink gave some
instructions to the liveried negro at the wheel, and
the car dashed up one of the steep roads which led
to the capital.</p>

<p>Not once since she had come ashore had the señora
appeared to notice the Camera Chap—he suspected
that she studiously refrained from doing so for
reasons which he fully appreciated—but just before
the automobile started she whispered something to
her fair companion, and the latter turned in her seat
and looked deliberately toward where he was standing.
There were several other persons in his vicinity,
and it might have been any of these at whom her
glance was directed, but Hawley, modest man though
he was, felt positive that he was the object of her
scrutiny, and somehow the thought afforded him much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He was not left long in ignorance as to the identity
of this prepossessing young woman, for, as the car<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
started off, the conversation of two natives standing
near him supplied him with that information.</p>

<p>“Is it not somewhat surprising that the daughter
of the American minister should be on such friendly
terms with the wife of the abominable Felix?”
Hawley overheard one of them remark in Spanish.
To which the other responded, with a shrug: “Nothing
is surprising about those Yankees.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap was too much absorbed in the
information he had gleaned even to feel like resenting
the slur upon his countrymen. So the girl in pink
was Miss Throgmorton, the daughter of the American
minister to Baracoa! And she was on such intimate
terms with Señora Felix that she alone had come to
welcome the latter back to her native land! Here
was an interesting discovery, indeed.</p>

<p>At that moment there flashed through his mind
what his friend and managing editor, Tom Paxton,
had said about the sentiments of the United States
minister to Baracoa toward the <cite>Sentinel</cite>, and all men
connected with it. He devoutly hoped that the daughter
did not share her father’s prejudices in that respect,
for he had already fully decided that if it were
possible he was going to make Miss Throgmorton’s
acquaintance before he had been many days in
Baracoa.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Camera Chap did not linger long at Puerto
Cabero. He had decided to make Santa Barbara, the
capital, his headquarters, that city being only ten miles
away from the seaport. It is situated on a highland
three thousand feet above the sea level, and, as Hawley
traveled on the antiquated railroad, he marveled
at the manner in which the line twisted and turned
like a huge corkscrew.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his journey’s end he found the
city in gala attire. The streets and shops were decorated
with flags and bunting, and a band was playing
in the plaza. At the Hotel Nacional, where he
registered, he inquired whether he had struck town
on a national holiday, and was informed that the festivities
were the result of the extraordinary scene he
had witnessed at Puerto Guerra the previous day.</p>

<p>“You see, señor,” explained the hotel clerk, who
spoke very good English, “President Portiforo has
ordered a day of public rejoicing because of the defeat
of General Rodriguez.”</p>

<p>“Rodriguez!” exclaimed Hawley, who recalled that
he had heard the man whom he had known as Juan
Cipriani hailed by that name by the group of wild-looking
horsemen on the pier. “What was he trying
to do? Was he starting a revolution?”</p>

<p>The clerk nodded, and proceeded to tell Hawley a<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
story which fully enlightened him as to the significance
of the drama he had seen enacted at the customhouse
at Puerto Guerra. The Camera Chap learned
that the big packing cases which the steamship <em>Colombia</em>
had brought, and which were invoiced as containing
farming implements, had in reality contained
machine guns intended for the use of the new revolutionary
party which General Emilio Rodriguez, alias
Juan Cipriani, had come to Baracoa to lead.</p>

<p>Rodriguez, Hawley was informed, was a native of
Baracoa, but had been in Europe for the past ten
years. He had held a commission in the French army,
which he had resigned in order to come back and attempt
to overthrow the Portiforo government; which
attempt, however, had been rendered futile by the
alertness of President Portiforo.</p>

<p>“But you don’t mean to tell me that that chap was
going to have the nerve to buck against the government
forces with that handful of men I saw at the
pier?” the Camera Chap exclaimed in astonishment.
“Why, there couldn’t have been more than fifty of
them in all.”</p>

<p>The clerk smiled deprecatingly. “That was only
the beginning, señor. If Rodriguez’s plans had not
miscarried, he was to have taken to the hills with
that escort, and there proclaimed the revolution. He
had been assured that the people would flock by thousands
to his banner, and that as soon as he gave the
word the army was prepared to revolt and go over
to him. But things didn’t go just as he expected.
President Portiforo learned of the plot in time to<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
nip the revolution in the bud. A few days ago he
raised the pay of everybody in the federal army,
from the commander in chief down to the newest recruit,
and thereby kept the troops loyal to him. He
set a trap for Rodriguez, and when that unhappy man
stepped off the boat at Puerto Guerra yesterday, expecting
the whole country to be ready to respond to
his call to arms, he was seized and thrown into jail.”
The clerk grinned. “One has to get up very early
in the morning in order to catch our President Portiforo
napping, señor,” he said.</p>

<p>“So I have heard,” the Camera Chap responded
dryly. “What do you suppose will happen to Cipriani—I
mean Rodriguez?”</p>

<p>The clerk shrugged his shoulders. “There is only
one fate for those who conspire against the government
of Baracoa,” he said quietly. “I understand
that the president has already signed his death warrant.”</p>

<p>Hawley was silent for a while after that. “Do you
happen to know,” he inquired suddenly, “whether your
former president, Francisco Felix, was mixed up in
any way with this revolutionary plot?”</p>

<p>The clerk stared at him in astonishment. “If such
is the case, it is the first time I have heard of it!”
he declared. “Might I inquire what put such a thought
in your head, señor? Have you any information to
that effect?”</p>

<p>“I?” exclaimed Hawley, with a deprecating smile.
“I arrived at Baracoa only a few hours ago. What<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
should I know about the affairs of your interesting
country?”</p>

<p>Later that day, Hawley got his first sight of Miguel
Portiforo, President of Baracoa. There was a big
military parade in honor of “the overthrow of the
revolution,” and the president rode at the head of his
troops in an open carriage, flanked on each side by an
escort of cavalry.</p>

<p>Standing in front of the Hotel Nacional, the Camera
Chap gazed with great interest upon the man with
whom he realized he must expect to match wits in
order to carry out the delicate and difficult errand
which had been intrusted to him. At first sight the
president did not impress him as being a man of
formidable personality. Although he wore a glittering
uniform of scarlet and gold, he was far from
presenting a military appearance. He was undersized
and exceedingly fat, and his bloated face was as round
as a pumpkin. As he smiled in acknowledgment of
the plaudits of the crowds, he looked like an easy-going,
jovial old boy, who would have been more at home
at a banquet table proposing a toast to “the ladies—God
bless ’em,” than ruling with an iron hand over
the political destinies of a turbulent South American
republic.</p>

<p>That was the first impression which the Camera
Chap formed of Miguel Portiforo, but just then an
incident happened which quickly caused him to change
his estimate of that dignitary. As the president’s carriage
was passing, a man in the front rank of the
crowd on the sidewalk outside the Hotel Nacional<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
stepped forward, and, gesticulating wildly, began to
abuse Portiforo in a tone loud enough to reach the
latter’s ears. The man was staggering as though intoxicated.
Hawley learned later that he was a humble
shoemaker of Santa Barbara, who, when in a normal
condition, was as meek and law-abiding a citizen as
was to be found in all Baracoa, but who now had been
celebrating the overthrow of the revolution to such
an extent that he was not responsible for what he
said or did. Although the fellow’s condition was
obvious, Portiforo made no allowance for it. Glancing
at the latter, the Camera Chap was appalled by
the change which had come over him as the drunken
man’s abuse fell upon his ears. The jovial smile had
disappeared. In its stead had come an expression
terrible to behold. The beady eyes were snapping
with rage. The thin lips were parted in a snarl.
Curiously the president’s plump face seemed suddenly
to have lost all its roundness, and to have been remolded
into lines sinister and cruel. It was not until
he had seen several soldiers rush forward, seize the
offender, and drag him off, struggling and screaming,
that his features relaxed, and the jovial smile returned.</p>

<p>“I wonder what will happen to the poor beggar,”
said a dapper, good-looking young man who was standing
close behind Hawley. “I suppose they’ll give him
the limit, eh?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so,” replied his companion, a blond-haired,
blue-eyed young woman. “Inasmuch as the
city has been put under martial law, Portiforo can<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
do as he pleases with him, and that brute isn’t likely
to show much clemency to a man who has publicly
insulted him.”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” entreated the young man nervously.
“Aren’t you taking an awful chance, Virginia, talking
like that in public? There may be people around us
who understand English, and even though you are the
daughter of the United States minister, you can’t—well
for the love of Methusaleh! If it isn’t old Frank
Hawley, of the <cite>Sentinel</cite>!”</p>

<p>Regretting the impulse which had caused him to
turn his head at this hint of the girl’s identity, Hawley
stared at the speaker in some consternation, for the
recognition was mutual. The Camera Chap was well
acquainted with Miss Throgmorton’s dapper companion.
The latter’s name was Gale, and he was a
reporter on the New York <cite>Daily News</cite>, the <cite>Sentinel’s</cite>
most bitter rival. Incidentally he was the last man
in the world whom Hawley would have desired to
meet in Baracoa.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A DIPLOMAT’S DAUGHTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Between the Camera Chap and Gale there existed
a feud of long standing, the intensity of which was
based upon more than mere loyalty for their respective
newspapers. Hawley knew the <cite>News</cite> man, from
past experience, as the trickiest, most unscrupulous
member of the journalistic profession he had ever
matched wits with on an assignment, and for that
reason disliked him exceedingly. But dislike would
hardly be a strong enough word to characterize the
sentiments of Gale toward Hawley. Jealousy and
resentment for many past defeats at the latter’s hands
had engendered in him a feeling of downright hatred
for the clever, good-humored chap who generally managed
to turn the tables on him in spite of his underhand
methods.</p>

<p>There was nothing of this feeling evident in Gale’s
manner now, however, as he greeted the Camera Chap.
On the contrary, if he had loved the latter like a twin
brother his demeanor could scarcely have been more
cordial. “Well, this is, indeed, a big surprise, Hawley,
old scout,” he exclaimed exuberantly. “I didn’t
have any idea that you were in Baracoa.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely expected to find you here, either,” the
Camera Chap replied quietly. “Might I inquire what
you are doing so far away from Park Row?”</p>

<p>“I’m not down here on business,” the other replied.<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
“I was so busy covering the street cleaners’ strike last
summer that I didn’t have time to take a vacation
then, so the boss is giving me a few weeks now. I
thought I might as well run down here and visit my
old friend, the American minister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an old friend,” Hawley repeated, glancing at
the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have had the honor of knowing Minister
Throgmorton for a long time, and when he was appointed
to this position he was kind enough to extend
me a standing invitation to come to Baracoa and be
his guest. As you say, it’s a long way from Park
Row, but I am having a great time.”</p>

<p>Hawley looked at him searchingly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“And now, how about yourself, old top?” the <cite>News</cite>
man demanded. “Tit for tat, you know. What particular
bunch of trouble has brought you down this
way? Haven’t come to lead a revolution, have you?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” the Camera Chap replied, smiling. “It
is a curious coincidence, but I, too, happen to be here
on a leave of absence. I haven’t had a vacation in
three years, so I figured that the paper owed me a
holiday.”</p>

<p>“What made you select Baracoa?” Gale demanded
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Why not?” the Camera Chap rejoined. “I’ve always
had a hankering to visit South America. Some
people prefer going to Europe, but I’ve always believed
in seeing our own hemisphere first.”</p>

<p>Gale was not satisfied by this answer. “Brought
your camera along with you?” he inquired abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Of course. I wouldn’t travel without it—even
on a pleasure trip. I hope to land some good snapshots
before I go back.”</p>

<p>“Snapshots of what?” Gale demanded quickly.</p>

<p>Hawley shrugged his shoulders in a manner which
would have done credit to a native of Baracoa. “That
is hard to say, at present,” he answered. “I have no
doubt that in a land as interesting as this, there must
be many attractive things to photograph.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked into the eyes of Gale’s fair
companion, and saw lurking in their blue depths an
appreciative twinkle which warned him that she knew
his secret. Evidently her friend, the señora, had taken
the girl into her confidence. The situation disturbed
him greatly. He wondered uneasily whether the
American minister’s daughter could be relied upon to
keep what she knew to herself, or whether she would
pass it along to Gale, with whom, evidently, she was
on friendly terms.</p>

<p>“Miss Throgmorton,” said Gale suddenly, “may I
present my friend, Mr. Hawley? You remember my
telling you the other day about Hawley, of the <cite>Sentinel</cite>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” the girl replied mischievously, as she extended
her hand; “I recall your telling me how often
you scooped him on pictures. I really felt quite sorry
for you, Mr. Hawley, when I heard Mr. Gale’s stories.
Newspaper work must be a cruel game.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled, and Gale looked somewhat
sheepish. In boasting of his exploits to his host’s
daughter, he had departed from the truth to an extent<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
which covered him with glory, but did not do justice
to the <cite>Sentinel</cite> man.</p>

<p>“Suppose we change the subject,” Gale said quickly.
“Possibly Mr. Hawley might find it painful, you know.
By the way, Frank, old man, I wonder if you’d mind
taking care of Miss Throgmorton for a few minutes,
while I go and make some inquiries about the attempt
that was just made on President Portiforo’s life?
Even though I’m on my vacation, I can’t afford to
pass up a story like that.”</p>

<p>“The attempt on Portiforo’s life?” the Camera Chap
repeated, in astonishment. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see that fellow try to throw a bomb
at him just now?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Gale!” Miss Throgmorton cried indignantly.
“You know very well he didn’t do anything
of the sort. The man was intoxicated, and he didn’t
do anything except call Portiforo names. Surely you
are not going to send your paper such an exaggerated
account!”</p>

<p>“I am positive I saw something in his hand that
looked like a bomb. He was just about to throw it
when they grabbed him,” insisted Gale, according to
whose code of journalistic ethics it was always justifiable
to “color” a story, provided one could get away
with it. “So long, folks. I’ll be back in a little while,”
he said, as he walked off.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap was grateful for this unlooked-for
opportunity to speak to the girl alone. “I must
have a talk with you, Miss Throgmorton,” he began,
in an eager whisper; “but not here. There is too<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
much danger of our being overheard. I hope you
will not consider me presumptuous, but it is really
very important. Isn’t there some place near here
where we can talk in safety?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “The Botanical Gardens are only
a short distance from here,” she suggested. “They
will be deserted now; every one is on the street watching
the parade. I, too, am anxious to have a talk
with you; in fact, even if we hadn’t met now, I was
going to make it a point to communicate with you
and arrange a meeting. I have a message for you—from
a mutual friend.”</p>

<p>Hawley smiled. He thought he could come pretty
near guessing the identity of the sender of the message.
“Don’t say any more about it now,” he warned
her hastily. “Wait until we reach the gardens.”</p>

<p>They forced their way to the rear of the throng
on the sidewalk, and a few minutes later were strolling
along the graceful walks of the Botanical Gardens,
which, although usually crowded at that hour of the
day, were now, as the girl had surmised, as desolate
as a desert island.</p>

<p>“Did I understand Gale to say that he is stopping
at your house?” Hawley began abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes; he is spending his vacation with us. My
father has taken a great fancy to him. When dad
was a deputy police commissioner in New York, Mr.
Gale wrote some very flattering things about him in
the <cite>News</cite>, and he has never forgotten it. Dad just
hates to have the newspapers publish nice things about
him,” she added, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care very much for Mr. Gale myself,”
she added frankly. “In fact, I do not like him at all.
When he first came to us I did. I was so favorably
impressed with him that I was on the point of taking
him into my confidence about—poor President Felix.”</p>

<p>Although her words greatly interested the Camera
Chap, his face was as a mask. “President Felix?”
he repeated, with an interrogative inflection.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see, I felt that I must share my secret
with some one, and I believed at first that Mr. Gale
would be just the person to help get that poor man
out of El Torro,” the girl said. “But after I had
studied him for a few days,” she added, “I decided
that he wouldn’t do at all; he isn’t trustworthy. I
feel sure that if he got even a hint of the story he
would publish it in his paper, regardless of the consequences.”</p>

<p>Hawley felt pretty sure of that, too. Inwardly he
rejoiced that Miss Throgmorton had changed her
mind about taking the perfidious Gale into her confidence.
Aloud he said, after a cautious glance all
around him: “So you suspect that President Felix
is confined in El Torro?”</p>

<p>Her reply almost took his breath away. “Suspect!”
she exclaimed tensely. “I know it. I have seen him!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">ON THE RIGHT TRACK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Camera Chap stared at the girl with as much
incredulity written on his face as if she had just told
him that she had been present when Columbus landed
in the New World. “You have seen him!” he exclaimed.
“Surely you can’t mean that you have been
inside El Torro?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do!” the girl declared, smiling slightly at
the effect her announcement had upon him. “I mean
just that. I have been inside El Torro, and I have
seen President Felix.”</p>

<p>“When was this?” Hawley demanded.</p>

<p>“Several months ago. I saw him only once—and
then only for one brief second. Since then I have
been trying my hardest to get in there again, but I
haven’t been able to manage it.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage it that time?” the Camera
Chap inquired, his manner still slightly incredulous,
although he did not intend it to be so. “I shouldn’t
imagine that it was an easy thing, even once.”</p>

<p>Virginia hesitated. She was debating with herself
as to whether this prepossessing, frank-looking young
man from her own country could safely be taken into
her confidence. “I feel that I can trust you, Mr.
Hawley,” she said suddenly. “If I didn’t I shouldn’t
tell you what I am going to tell you now. For if it
were to become known to others the consequences
might be serious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>She glanced around her in all directions, and even
when she had ascertained that there was nobody within
earshot, lowered her voice almost to a whisper.
“There is a certain young man of my acquaintance,”
she began, “who is an officer in the Baracoan army.
His name is Reyes—Captain Ernesto Reyes. You
must promise me to forget that name as soon as you
have heard the story, Mr. Hawley.”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten it already,” the Camera Chap
assured her.</p>

<p>The girl smiled. “I met him at an embassy ball,
about a year ago, and we became very good friends.
He was attached to El Torro and had charge of the
prison guard. It was through him that I was able
to visit the prison.”</p>

<p>“He permitted you to enter the prison?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he smuggled me in there. He was running
a great risk, of course.”</p>

<p>“So I should imagine,” said the Camera Chap. “He
must be very fond of—President Felix,” he added
dryly.</p>

<p>Virginia blushed. “No; I’m sorry to say that isn’t
the case. If it were so it would make things so much
easier for us. It wasn’t out of any consideration for
President Felix that Captain Reyes allowed me to
visit his prison. It—there were other reasons. Captain
Reyes is far from being a Felix sympathizer.
On the contrary, he has a deadly grudge against him.
I guess that is why Portiforo has put him in charge
of El Torro prison; he knows that there is no chance
of Felix being allowed to escape while he is in charge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>Hawley frowned. “Why is he so bitter toward
Felix?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“He has cause, I must admit,” the girl explained,
her face clouding. “Captain Reyes’ father was a
colonel in the Baracoan army when Mr. Felix first
became president. He was caught conspiring against
the government, and Felix ordered him to be shot. I
don’t know anything about the merits of the case,
but, right or wrong, I suppose it is only natural that
the son should hate the man who signed his father’s
death warrant.”</p>

<p>Hawley nodded. “But if he feels that way about
it, whatever could have possessed him to consent to
your communicating with the prisoner?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Virginia’s blue eyes twinkled. “He didn’t consent
to any such thing,” she said demurely. “He didn’t
have any idea that I desired to see President Felix,
or that I had the slightest interest in him. He supposed
that my anxiety to inspect the dungeons was
prompted solely by morbid curiosity.”</p>

<p>“Still, I can’t understand his being so rash as to
let you in there,” said Hawley.</p>

<p>The girl’s face dimpled. “He couldn’t help himself;
I called his bluff,” she announced, laughing apologetically
at her own frank use of American slang.</p>

<p>“His bluff?”</p>

<p>“Like most of his countrymen, Captain Reyes has
the habit of indulging in very extravagant language
when he is talking to women,” Miss Throgmorton
explained naïvely. “One evening when he was at our
house he was assuring me, with his hand on his heart,<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
of his readiness to lay down his life for me, and I
laughed at his protestations and told him that in my
native land that brand of talk was known as ‘hot air.’
He urged me to put him to the test, and, after pretending
to consider for a while, I told him that I
wouldn’t ask him to risk his life, but that if he really
wanted to show that he was willing to take chances
for my sake, he could do so by taking me on a tour
of inspection through El Torro prison.”</p>

<p>Hawley chuckled. “Clever work! You knew, then,
that President Felix was there?”</p>

<p>“I had heard the rumor, and I thought it was a good
chance to find out whether it was true. I could see
that poor Captain Reyes was startled by my request.
He protested that it was against the rules to admit
visitors to El Torro. He begged me to put him to
some other test. But I insisted that it must be that
or nothing. I taunted him with being afraid to take
a chance, and at last I got the poor man so worked
up that he gritted his teeth and said that he would
do it, no matter what the consequences might be.”</p>

<p>“Good for him!” said Hawley. “He must be a
pretty plucky chap.”</p>

<p>“He is no coward,” said the girl soberly. “I hated
to demand such a sacrifice of him; for although I
didn’t let him know it, I realized that I was making
him do something which, if he had been caught, would
have meant the ruin of his career—and, perhaps,
worse. But it was for a good cause, and I considered
myself justified. Anyway,” she added brightly,
“thank goodness, nothing like that happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>“He got away with it, all right?”</p>

<p>“Evidently; for that was several months ago, and
he is still in command of the prison guard; which
wouldn’t be the case, of course, if even a hint of my
visit to El Torro had reached the ears of Portiforo.”</p>

<p>“So he is still in charge of the prison guard!” murmured
the Camera Chap, inwardly resolving to make
the acquaintance of Captain Ernesto Reyes at the
earliest possible opportunity. “Do you mean to say
that he took you all over the prison—even to the cell
in which they’ve got Felix locked up?” he continued
wonderingly. “Surely it would have been an easy
matter for him to avoid showing you that particular
cell.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “He didn’t find it so easy. He
did attempt to hurry me past that cell, but, to borrow
your own expression, he couldn’t get away with it.
I peeped through the hole in the panel before he had
a chance to stop me.”</p>

<p>“The hole in the panel?”</p>

<p>“They have put sheets of tin over the bars of President
Felix’s dungeon to prevent anybody in the corridor
from getting a glimpse of him,” the girl explained.
“But the tin had rusted, and there was a
tiny hole in one corner which evidently had escaped
the attention of the prison officials. It was through
this hole that I got my peep at the unfortunate man.”</p>

<p>“How did you know he was in there?” the Camera
Chap queried.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, of course. I merely guessed it.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
As soon as I saw that covered door it flashed through
my mind that it would most likely be the place where
they would have him. And Captain Reyes’ manner
confirmed my suspicions. When I inquired of him
why the door of this cell was covered with sheets of
tin instead of being grilled like all the other doors on
that gloomy corridor, he became perceptibly nervous.
He explained that the cell was unoccupied, and was
used as a storage room; but while he was talking I
heard the sound of somebody coughing behind that
screened door, and I knew that he had lied to me.
Captain Reyes heard it, too, but evidently he was in
hopes that it had escaped my ears, for he tried to hurry
me away by telling me that he had something exceedingly
interesting to show me in another part of
the prison. But I broke away from him and stepped
close up to the door. It was then that I discovered
the tiny peephole which the rust had eaten in one
part of the tin, and before he could stop me I had
put my eye to it.”</p>

<p>“And you saw?” The Camera Chap’s voice was
tense with eagerness.</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered slightly. “I saw a man seated
at a rough wooden table reading a book. Just at that
moment he happened to look up, and I got a good
view of his face. He had changed terribly since I
had last seen him. His hair was snowy white, his
face was pitifully thin, and looked as if it didn’t have
a drop of blood in it. His eyes were sunken. But
it was President Felix; I am absolutely positive of
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>The Camera Chap’s face was grim. “You say that
he was reading. Was his cell light enough for that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; there was plenty of light, and air, too.
I must say in justice to Portiforo that he has made
his prisoner as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.
The dungeon is much bigger than the
other cells, and there is a large window, barred, of
course, which commands a view of the sea.”</p>

<p>Hawley’s face lighted up with excitement. “I
rather like the idea of that window!” he murmured,
as if to himself. “Our friend Portiforo is much more
accommodating than I dared hope.”</p>

<p>Guessing what was in his mind, Virginia shook her
head. “I’m afraid you won’t be so optimistic when
I tell you that there is a sentinel on guard every hour
of the night and day outside of that window,” she
said. “You couldn’t possibly get to him in that way.”</p>

<p>Hawley received the announcement cheerfully. “I
expected that,” he informed her. “I didn’t suppose
for a minute, you know, that Portiforo would be so
careless as to leave the window unguarded. Still, it’s
easier to tackle the problem of a flesh-and-blood sentry
than an inanimate stone wall. But go on with your
story, please. What happened after you took that
peep at Felix? Captain Reyes saw what you were
up to, of course?”</p>

<p>The girl smiled. “Of course; and the change that
came over him was truly startling. His face went
white with rage, and his voice trembled as he accused
me of being a spy, and of having tricked him. I was
actually afraid at first that he was going to order<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
poor little me arrested and put in irons. It was a great
relief to me when he apologized.”</p>

<p>Hawley smiled. “You made him apologize?”</p>

<p>Virginia nodded, and her blue eyes twinkled.
“When he was through with his violent outburst,”
she said demurely, “I decided that it was my turn to
become indignant. I told him haughtily that I didn’t
see why he should make such a fuss just because my
curiosity had got the best of me. I complained tearfully
that I was sorry now that I had consented to
come to his horrid old prison, and that I had been
through jails in my own country, which I found much
more interesting. I guess my words and my manner
must have satisfied him at length that I had not recognized
the prisoner, for, after he had asked me a few
questions, he suddenly became very remorseful for
his rough treatment, and begged me to forgive him.
Later on, when we were good friends again, I inquired
of him carelessly as to the identity of the man
I had seen in that cell, and he informed me glibly that
he was a political agitator named Pedro Velasquez,
who had been in captivity for the past fifteen years.
He was even ingenious enough to tell me that the poor
fellow had gone out of his mind, and had hallucinations
that he was President Felix. I smiled at this
and replied that there certainly wasn’t much resemblance
between the prisoner and President Felix as I
remembered him, which was literally true.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap bestowed upon her a look of
frank admiration. “You’re a wonder, Miss Throgmorton!”
he declared impulsively. “I don’t know any<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
girl who could have handled the situation more cleverly.
I suppose,” he added anxiously, “you told your
father of your discovery?”</p>

<p>Miss Throgmorton shook her head. “No; I decided
that it wouldn’t do to tell dad a word about it.
He thinks so highly of Portiforo that I felt sure that
he would only laugh at my story, and tell me that
my imagination had got the best of me. Besides, I
had to consider Captain Reyes. I was afraid that if
I told my father of my visit to the prison he might
mention the matter to President Portiforo, and thus
get Captain Reyes into trouble. I haven’t confided
my secret to anybody except yourself and Señora
Felix. By the way!” she exclaimed. “Speaking of the
señora reminds me that I have a message for you
from her. She told me to assure you that she has
the greatest confidence in your ability and discretion,
but she wishes to urge upon you the necessity of being
most careful. On no account must you attempt
to see her at her father’s house. The place is watched
by spies all the time. If for any reason you should
wish to communicate with her, she suggests that it
be done through me.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap bowed. “A very sensible
arrangement,” he said, “and one that is eminently satisfactory
to me.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and her color deepened. “I think
we’d better be getting back,” she suggested. “The
parade must be over, for people are beginning to come
into the park.”</p>

<p>As they stepped outside the Botanical Gardens they<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
encountered Gale. That young man frowned at the
sight of them. “Why, here you are!” he exclaimed
reproachfully. “I’ve been looking all over for you.
I thought you promised to wait for me outside the
Hotel Nacional.”</p>

<p>“We got tired of watching the parade, so we
thought we’d walk around a bit,” Hawley replied.
“Did you get the information you wanted about the
attempted assassination of Portiforo?” he inquired
quizzically.</p>

<p>Gale nodded. “I found out the fellow’s name and
business,” he replied. “That’s all I needed. It’s a
peach of a story. I’m going to put it on the wire in
a little while. Would you like to send it to your
paper, too, old man?”</p>

<p>Hawley smiled. He knew from past experiences
that when Gale offered to share a story with a rival
newspaper, it was never out of motives of altruism,
but because the story was so much the product of
his imagination that it gave him a greater sense of
security to have his statements backed up by another
sheet. “No, thanks,” he said dryly. “I guess I won’t
touch it. I’m a snapshotter, and sending stories is
somewhat out of my line. Besides, I’m on my vacation,
so why should I work?”</p>

<p>Gale looked at him searchingly. “Of course, you
wouldn’t think of working on your vacation, would
you?” he rejoined, with an ironical smile.</p>

<p>When, a few minutes later, the Camera Chap took
his leave, the <cite>News</cite> man turned eagerly to Virginia.<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
“Did he happen to drop you any hint of what he’s
doing in Baracoa, Miss Throgmorton?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The girl’s blue eyes opened wide in childlike wonder.
“A hint?” she said innocently. “Why didn’t
he tell us outright that he’s spending his vacation
here?”</p>

<p>Gale smiled sapiently. “Vacation or no vacation,
that fellow didn’t come here to study the scenery!”
he declared. “He is here for a purpose, and before
I’m many days older I’m going to find out what it is.”</p>

</div>


<p>It was not often that the Washington correspondent
of the New York <cite>Daily News</cite> visited the home office
of that newspaper, particularly when Congress was
in session. Therefore Ben Stephens, the managing
editor, looked up from his desk in astonishment one
afternoon when that young man stepped into his office.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a line on something so important,” the
latter explained, “that I was afraid to trust it to the
wires. I might have sent it in by mail, of course, but
I thought it would be more satisfactory to run into
town and talk it over with you. I think you’ll agree
that it’s one of the hottest tips that ever came out
of Washington.”</p>

<p>“A scandal?” eagerly exclaimed Stephens. “Haven’t
caught a United States senator with the goods, have
you?”</p>

<p>The correspondent smiled. “Not exactly. It’s a
scandal, all right, and a whopping big one, but a little
farther from home than that. You remember that
chap Felix, President of Baracoa, who skipped with
the national treasury a couple of years ago?”</p>

<p>The managing editor nodded. “What about him?
Have they caught the rascal?”</p>

<p>The Washington correspondent lowered his voice.
“According to the tip I’ve got, he never went away,”
he announced. “It was all a frame-up on the part<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
of his political enemies, headed by Portiforo. They’ve
got him locked up in a dungeon of El Torro fortress,
where he’s been ever since the night he’s supposed to
have beaten it.”</p>

<p>Stephens smiled skeptically. “What kind of tobacco
do you smoke?” he sneered.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a pipe dream,” the other said earnestly.
“At least, I’m pretty well satisfied that the tip is
straight goods. It comes from a most authoritative
source.” He dropped his voice even lower. “I got it
from Attorney General Cooper.”</p>

<p>The managing editor’s face lighted up. “From
Cooper himself?”</p>

<p>The correspondent hesitated. “Well, I didn’t exactly
hear it from his own lips, but it came from him,
all right. The fact is I got the tip from one of the
servants of the attorney general’s household—his butler.
But the fellow is absolutely to be relied on. I
have had him on my pay roll for the last six months,
and he’s never given me a wrong steer yet. You
remember that scoop last winter about the wife of
that European ambassador losing twenty-five thousand
at bridge? Well, that tip came from him. That chap
is a regular bear for news. There is mighty little
going on at the capital that he doesn’t hear about.”</p>

<p>Stephens grinned appreciatively. “Where did he get
this fairy story about Felix?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“From Mrs. Cooper’s maid. You know that until
recently Señora Felix has been stopping at the attorney
general’s house. She and Mrs. Cooper are very
chummy. Naturally they talked together frequently<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
about the matter, and the maid managed to overhear
most of what they said, and passed it along to my
trusty informant. It seems that the women have been
getting at the attorney general to put the proposition
before the president, and have him order an investigation,
and a few weeks ago Cooper brought it up
at a cabinet meeting.”</p>

<p>Stephens became more interested. “Have you asked
the president about it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I was afraid that instead of telling
me anything, he’d make me promise not to print a
line about what I already knew, and then I’d have to
take my choice between passing up the story or being
in bad at the White House. Either that, or else,
seeing that the <cite>News</cite> has the tip, he’d hand out the
story to the whole Washington bunch; for the president
makes it a rule not to play any favorites.”</p>

<p>Stephens nodded. “Under those circumstances, you
were quite right not to take any chances. Still,” he
added pensively, “I don’t see what we can do with the
tip in its present form. It would hardly pay us to
send a man down to Baracoa.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” the correspondent protested. “It’s a
big story if it’s true and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, if it’s true!” the managing editor interrupted
doubtfully. “If I thought there was a ten-per-cent
chance of there being anything in this wild rumor,
I wouldn’t mind the expense of sending five men
down there to dig up the story, even if we had to
charter a private yacht, but with all due respect to
your friend, the attorney general’s butler, this sounds<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
to me like the effects of a combination of Welsh rabbit
and strawberry shortcake, with a couple of slabs
of custard pie thrown in. I don’t feel like spending
even ten cents on such an impossible yarn.”</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, his face lighted up. “By Jove!
I was forgetting!” he exclaimed. “We don’t have to
send a man down there. We’ve got a man in Baracoa
now—and a good one, too.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Gale, of our city staff. He’s taking a month’s
vacation, and that’s where he went to spend it. He
sent us a good story from there a couple of days
ago about an attempt on the life of Portiforo. I
couldn’t have picked a better man than Gale for an
assignment of this sort. He’s got more gall than any
other reporter on our staff. If Felix is locked up in
El Torro fortress, I’ll bank on Gale being able to
locate him. I’ll wire him to-day to get busy.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that a week after the Camera
Chap’s arrival in San Cristobal, Gale received a dispatch,
the laconic but comprehensive contents of
which caused him to seek an immediate interview with
his host, the United States minister to Baracoa.</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton was in his library in conversation
with a tall, bearded man, when Gale knocked
on the door. “I beg your pardon, I didn’t know you
were busy,” the <cite>News</cite> man said. “Perhaps I’d better
come back later. It isn’t anything important.”</p>

<p>“Come right in,” the United States representative
responded genially. “I want you to meet General
Replife, minister of war in President Portiforo’s cabinet.<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
General, permit me to present my friend, Mr.
Gale, a New York journalist of distinction. Now,
Gale, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“It is nothing important,” Gale repeated. “I merely
wanted to ask you whether it would be possible for
you to get me a pass to go through the fortress of
El Torro.”</p>

<p>“El Torro!” exclaimed Minister Throgmorton
sharply. “For what reason do you want to go there?”</p>

<p>Gale shrugged his shoulders. “Merely on a sightseeing
tour, sir,” he replied, conscious, as he spoke,
that the dark eyes of General Replife were fixed scrutinizingly
on his face. “I’ve heard that it is an interesting
sort of place, and I shouldn’t like to return
to New York without being able to say that I had
included it among the places I visited.”</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton frowned. He was a stout,
pompous little man, with an odd little gray beard,
which sprouted from his chin like a miniature whisk
broom. “I am afraid that is out of the question,”
he said. “I believe visitors are not welcome at El
Torro, eh, general?”</p>

<p>The minister of war bowed. “There is a strictly
enforced rule to that effect, señor,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I know there is,” said Gale, smiling. “That is
why I have come to you, Mr. Throgmorton, to ask
you to use your pull to get me in.” He hesitated;
then, with a sudden show of candor: “I might as
well be quite frank with you, sir. It isn’t merely idle
curiosity which makes me desirous of visiting the
fortress. I don’t know whether I have mentioned it<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
to you before, but the study of prisons has always
been my hobby. I have visited nearly all the big jails
in the United States, and some in foreign countries.
Some day I hope to get up a magazine article on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed General Replife, addressing the
minister. “Then it is the dungeons of El Torro, not
the fortifications, in which your friend is interested?
I think that might be arranged, Señor Throgmorton.
If you will vouch for this gentleman, there will be no
objection to his being shown through the prison part
of the fortress. I will make out a permit now.”</p>

<p>Gale expressed his gratitude and delight; but, as a
matter of fact, he was secretly disappointed. When
entering the room, he had been fully aware of the
identity of his host’s distinguished visitor, and he
had made his request, not with the idea of having it
granted, but with the expectation that when he heard
it, Portiforo’s minister of war would be filled with
consternation. In that case Gale would have had
cause to believe that there was something in the tip
which his paper had instructed him to investigate.
But now, General Replife’s willingness to let him go
through the prison caused him to doubt that Felix
was confined there.</p>

<p>“Present this order to the commandant of El Torro,
and he will show you all that you wish to see,” said
the minister of war graciously, handing him the paper
which he had just made out. “I trust you will find
there, señor, some interesting material for the magazine
article you wish to write.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A MYSTERIOUS SUMMONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The end of the Camera Chap’s first week in Baracoa
found him not much nearer to the fulfillment of his
mission than on the day of his arrival. He had made
several trips on the crooked little railway which connected
the capital with Porto Cabero, and as unobtrusively
as possible had hung around the cafés and
public places of the seaport. As the soldiers from the
fortress, when off duty, patronized these places, he
was in hopes that by mingling with them, and keeping
his eyes and ears wide open, he might pick up
something which would aid him in the performance of
his task.</p>

<p>In addition to this he had chartered a motor boat
and made many excursions into the harbor, hovering
around El Torro fortress, and making a careful,
though futile, study of the exterior of that grim edifice.
Although none of these efforts had as yet been
productive of results, he was not discouraged. With
characteristic patience and optimism he felt confident
that sooner or later he would hit upon a solution of
the big problem which confronted him.</p>

<p>During this time he had held several consultations
with his fair confederate, Virginia Throgmorton.
The latter, who was fond of horseback riding, was in
the habit of taking long rides daily out into the country.
At her suggestion, the Camera Chap hired a<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
mount, and went for frequent canters in the same
direction. Thus they were able to meet and compare
notes, safe from prying eyes and ears—or, at least,
so they believed. But one afternoon, when Hawley
galloped off into the outskirts of San Cristobal, to
keep one of these trysts, Virginia met him with a troubled
expression on her usually serene countenance.</p>

<p>“This is the last time that we must meet here—or
anywhere else, for that matter!” she declared firmly.
“I’m afraid we’ve been inexcusably careless.”</p>

<p>“Careless?” the Camera Chap repeated wonderingly.
“My dear Miss Throgmorton, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>The girl turned in her saddle, and shot nervous
glances about her in all directions. “We ought to have
foreseen the folly of this,” she said severely. “We
might have known that we couldn’t meet like this
without being found out.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that such a thing has happened?”
exclaimed the Camera Chap.</p>

<p>Virginia nodded gloomily. “My father was asking
me about you this morning,” she announced. “He
wanted to know how many times I had met you. He
also evinced painful curiosity as to where I go, and
whom I meet, when I take my daily canter. I could
tell from his mode of questioning that he knows about
these meetings.”</p>

<p>“Who could have told him?” said the Camera Chap.
“I have always been careful when coming out here
to make sure that I was not shadowed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“So have I,” returned the girl, with a rueful smile.
“Nevertheless, we have evidently been spied upon. I
have a shrewd suspicion that it was Mr. Gale who
told my father. He and dad were talking very confidentially
together as I came into the room this morning,
and I’m almost positive that I heard your name
mentioned.”</p>

<p>Hawley frowned. “I guess that is very probable,”
he said. “I’ve run into Gale quite often during the
past few days, and I’ve had reason to believe that the
encounters weren’t accidental—that he’s been paying
me the compliment of watching me very closely. I
hope he doesn’t suspect the reasons for our meeting,
Miss Throgmorton. He’s the last man on earth that
I would want to have know what I am doing here.”</p>

<p>Virginia sighed. “My great fear is that Portiforo,
too, has learned about these meetings of ours,” she
said anxiously. “If so, I am afraid that he’ll put two
and two together. They know that I visit Señora
Felix, and they might easily assume from the fact that
you and I meet so often that your presence in Baracoa
is in relation to her cause. That, of course, would be
fatal to your chances of success—and,” she added,
with a shudder, “perhaps fatal to President Felix,
too. We ought to have thought of that before; but at
least we must take the precaution of avoiding each
other from now on. You must hold no communication
with me whatever—not even through a third person.
We cannot be too careful.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap was forced to admit the wisdom
of this decision. From that day he seemed suddenly<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
to have lost all interest in horseback riding, for he
took no more canters into the outskirts of San Cristobal.
And when, on one or two occasions, he encountered
Miss Throgmorton, riding or walking on the
streets of the capital, he merely saluted her formally,
and passed her by without a word.</p>

<p>One evening, about a week later, as he was entering
his hotel, a man stepped up close to him and covertly
slipped a small envelope into his hand. “Don’t open
this, señor, until you are alone in your room,” he
cautioned in a hurried whisper.</p>

<p>The contents of the envelope puzzled the Camera
Chap exceedingly. In the seclusion of his room he
read and reread the mysterious message in English,
and evidently in a man’s handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is of urgent importance that you call upon
Doctor Gaspard Bonsal, at nine o’clock, this evening.
The address is Avenida Juarez, opposite the cathedral.
Please come alone, and make sure that you are not
followed before entering the house.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hawley’s first impulse was to go downstairs and
ask the hotel clerk whether he knew of any such person
as Doctor Gaspard Bonsal, and, if so, what he
knew about him. But, on second thought, he decided
that in the event of the mysterious message being
genuine, and not the hoax he was inclined to suspect
that it might be, such a step might prove unwise. The
clerk was a talkative chap, and might repeat to others
any questions that were put to him.</p>

<p>So Hawley decided to take a chance and call upon
the mysterious Doctor Gaspard Bonsal without taking<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
the precaution of making any inquiries about him.
There was one fact which he considered slightly reassuring.
Although there was nothing about the note
to indicate whether the person referred to was a physician,
a horse doctor, or a doctor of philosophy, Hawley
recognized the address as being in the most exclusive
residence section of the capital. He had walked
several times along the Avenida Juarez, and had
noted the pretentious residences which lined that well-lighted
thoroughfare, particularly in the vicinity of
the cathedral; so he felt satisfied, at least, that this
was no ruse to lure him into some dark alleyway in
the slums of San Cristobal.</p>

<p>The address was only a short distance from the
hotel, and Hawley proceeded there on foot, carefully
observing the warning which the message had contained
to make sure that he was not followed. He
had no difficulty in picking out Doctor Gaspard Bonsal’s
house, for there was a brass plate on the door
bearing that name. This discovery added greatly to
his confidence; nevertheless, as he climbed the low
stoop and pressed the bell button, he took the precaution
of keeping one hand in his coat pocket, with a
businesslike grip on the automatic pistol it contained.</p>

<p>The door was opened by an aged negro servant,
who, without asking any questions, ushered him into
a handsomely furnished reception room, and quietly
disappeared.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, as Hawley was appreciatively
studying one of the oil paintings which lined the walls,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
a gray-bearded, fine-looking old man entered the
room.</p>

<p>“You are Mr. Hawley?” he inquired. He spoke
excellent English, although his appearance was decidedly
Latin.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I presume I have the honor of addressing
Doctor Bonsal?” As Hawley spoke, his hand came
out of his pocket; for the sight of this fine, courtly
old man removed his last apprehension.</p>

<p>Doctor Bonsal bowed. “I must apologize most
profoundly for having summoned you here in such a
mysterious way,” he said, with a smile, “but I assure
you, sir, it was most necessary. The circumstances
are such that we cannot be too careful. Had I sent
my carriage for you, as I would have liked to do, it
might have aroused suspicion.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Hawley assured him. “It was
only a short walk.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure that you were not followed
here?” There was great anxiety in the other’s tone.</p>

<p>“Positive. At least, if there were any spies trailing
me, I’m satisfied that I’m a good case for an oculist,”
said the Camera Chap, with a laugh. “I kept a sharp
lookout for them.”</p>

<p>“I trust you were not deceived,” remarked Doctor
Bonsal gravely. “If you will be good enough, Mr.
Hawley, to accompany me into the next room, I think
you will immediately realize the wisdom and necessity
of these extreme precautions.”</p>

<p>He drew aside some sliding doors, and the Camera
Chap followed him into the room adjoining. A woman<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
was seated there. She rose as they entered, and, as
he gazed into her dark, sad eyes, Hawley gave a start
of astonishment. Although he had suspected ever
since entering the house that Señora Felix was connected
in some way with this mysterious summons, he
had not expected to find her there.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE PLEA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Although only a few days had elapsed since the
Camera Chap had last seen Señora Felix, he was
shocked at the change which had come over her in
that time. There were dark circles under her eyes, and
her face was drawn and haggard. She seemed to be
on the verge of a nervous collapse.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is a surprise to you to find me here,
Mr. Hawley?” she began, with a pathetic smile.</p>

<p>“Somewhat, I must confess, señora, in view of the
warning you sent me not to attempt to communicate
with you,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I felt that I must see you, in spite of the great
risk,” she said. “I feared that there was slight chance
of persuading you to grant the great favor I am compelled
to ask of you, unless I made the appeal in
person. I am confident that no matter what it will
mean to you, you will not refuse to be moved by the
pleadings of a most unhappy woman. So I induced
our good friend, Doctor Bonsal, to arrange this meeting.”</p>

<p>The venerable physician acknowledged this reference
to himself by a bow. “It was the only safe way,
sir,” he explained simply to Hawley. “The señora’s
home is watched so closely that it would have been out
of the question for her to receive you there. As I am
in attendance, professionally, upon her father, and<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
it is known that she calls here frequently to consult me
about his condition, it looked to me like a feasible
plan to have you meet here.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea,” the Camera Chap returned.
“You spoke of a favor you wished to ask of me,
señora. Without waiting to hear what it is, I assure
you that if it lies within my power to grant it——”</p>

<p>“It does,” she interrupted eagerly. Then, with
startling abruptness: “I want you to leave Baracoa
immediately, Mr. Hawley. I want you to give up this
mad attempt to help my unfortunate husband. No
good can come of it—nothing but a great deal of harm.
The steamship <em>Panama</em>, bound for New York, is due
to arrive at Puerto Cabero to-morrow. If you are sincere
in your desire to be of service to us, you will prove
it by engaging passage on her.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled regretfully. “I am afraid
I cannot promise to do that, señora—not unless there
is a very good reason. May I inquire why you have
so suddenly lost faith in me? The other day, on the
<em>Colombia</em>, you sent me a message that your only hope
was in my ability to carry out the mission intrusted
to me; and later you sent me another message that you
had the greatest confidence in me. What can have
happened to cause you to change your mind?”</p>

<p>The señora sighed. “I have not lost confidence in
you,” she said. “From what I have heard of your
great skill and courage, I think it quite likely that you
would succeed in doing what you have been sent to do.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap stared at her in astonishment.
“Then why——” he began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>“Because whether you succeed or fail,” she broke
in passionately, “the result must be the same. When
I urged you, the other day, to persevere in your desperate
undertaking, I had not stopped to consider that.
I believed, then, that your success would bring about
my poor husband’s freedom. But now”—she paused,
and a look of great fear came into her dark eyes—“now
I know that inevitably it would mean his death.
Whatever the outcome of your adventure, its price
would be my husband’s life—and that is too great a
price to pay, even for his vindication.”</p>

<p>“But it won’t be that way if I get the snapshot,”
Hawley protested confidently. “I can understand your
fears, señora; but, believe me, they are groundless.
If we can get photographic evidence that President
Felix is locked up in El Torro they won’t dare touch
him. Portiforo is too smart a man to try anything of
that sort. Once he knows that we’ve got the evidence,
he’ll realize that the game is up, and that he’d only be
making matters worse for himself if he were to attempt
to assassinate your husband. So you see,” he concluded
cheerfully, “if I can get the picture everything
will be all right.”</p>

<p>The señora shook her head. “You don’t know
Portiforo,” she said bitterly. “He’d assassinate my
husband first, and argue about the genuineness of the
photograph afterward. If for no other reason, he’d
do it out of revenge. No, Mr. Hawley, you cannot
save my husband that way. The only way you can
help us is by doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“But maybe your fears are exaggerated,” the<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
Camera Chap suggested, as a new argument presented
itself to his mind. “If Portiforo is capable of committing
such a cold-blooded murder, why hasn’t he
done it before now? Surely it would have been much
safer for him to have put President Felix to death
in the first place, instead of throwing him into prison.
Doesn’t the fact that he didn’t take that course indicate
that he draws the line at assassination?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t mercy, sir, which made Portiforo spare
his victim’s life,” said Doctor Bonsal quietly. “It was
necessity. At least, so we have cause to believe.”</p>

<p>“Necessity?” Hawley repeated curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes; our theory is that he was compelled to do so.
General Replife, although one of Portiforo’s intimates
and fellow conspirators, was under great obligations
to President Felix,” the physician explained. “It is
our belief that it was he who saved him from assassination.
Replife had a little more conscience than the
others, and although he was willing to take part in
the dastardly plot, his past friendship for Felix caused
him to insist that the victim’s life be spared. He persuaded
Portiforo that their ends could be served just
as well by locking up the president in El Torro as by
murdering him. And Portiforo, afraid to antagonize
Replife, was forced to consent to this plan. That is our
theory, and we feel sure that it is the correct one.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it is,” argued Hawley, “isn’t that good
reason to assume that President Felix’s life isn’t in
danger? If Replife wouldn’t stand for assassination
before, the chances are that he won’t stand for it now.
So you see, señora, there is nothing to fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Señora Felix looked at him in astonishment. “Can
it be possible that you have not heard the news?” she
exclaimed. “General Replife was shot down by an
assassin as he was leaving the war office this afternoon.
There is now nobody to prevent Portiforo from doing
as he pleases with my unfortunate husband.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE SEÑORA OR THE PRESIDENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“To-day’s tragedy has made the situation a hundred
times worse than it was before,” moaned Señora Felix
despairingly, looking appealingly at Hawley and the
old physician. “Replife was a bad man, but, at least,
there was a spark of humanity in him which made
him unwilling to countenance the murder of his former
benefactor. He was our only hope. Now that he is
gone, it will take only the slightest provocation to
make Portiforo do away with my poor Francisco.”
She paused, and a shudder shook her frail frame.
“Who knows that he has not already been butchered!
I cannot help fearing that the assassin’s act was inspired
by Portiforo, who realized the necessity of getting
out of the way the only man who stood between
him and his helpless victim.”</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands, and burst into
a violent paroxysm of weeping. The Camera Chap
and Doctor Bonsal looked at each other helplessly.
The latter shook his head commiseratingly. Presently
he walked over to the grief-stricken woman and placed
his hand gently on her shoulder. “Courage, my dear
señora,” he murmured, his voice as tender as a woman’s.
“Be brave, I entreat you, my dear friend. After
all, we have not yet heard from the hospital. Until
we get word from Doctor Picard we will not give up
hope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>He turned and explained to Hawley: “We have
hope that Replife’s injury may turn out to be not so
serious as was at first reported. He has been taken
to the Red Cross Hospital, and an operation, I understand,
is to be performed. My good friend, Doctor
Picard, the house surgeon, has promised to apprise
me as soon as there is news.”</p>

<p>Hawley nodded. “Let’s hope that when it comes it
will be good news!” he exclaimed briskly. “Señora, I
know from my newspaper experience that such reports
are usually exaggerated. There may still be lots of
fight left in General Replife. And even if there isn’t,”
he added confidently, “even if the worst comes to the
worst, so far as he is concerned, you are wrong in
saying that there will be nobody to prevent Portiforo
from doing as he pleases with President Felix.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried the woman and Doctor
Bonsal, in an eager chorus.</p>

<p>“I am referring to a powerful old gentleman named
Uncle Sam,” Hawley said smilingly. “Portiforo
no doubt is wise enough to realize that he would have
the United States to reckon with if he tries any treachery
of that sort.”</p>

<p>The señora breathed a murmur of disappointment.
“Your government can do nothing—absolutely nothing,”
she said hopelessly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, señora, but you are mistaken
about that,” the Camera Chap protested. “Once the
photographic evidence is placed in the hands of the
President of the United States, nothing——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>The woman interrupted him with a cry. “I tell you
that must not be,” she exclaimed, almost fiercely.
“Surely, Mr. Hawley, after what you have heard, you
will not persist in going on with your impossible adventure?
You must realize that our only hope of saving
my husband’s life, now, lies in our ability to prevent
anything from being done which would provoke
that tyrant to take desperate measures.”</p>

<p>“Señora Felix is right, sir,” Doctor Bonsal chimed
in earnestly. “I sincerely trust that you will not refuse
to be guided by her wishes in the matter. You
must appreciate the logic of our contention. If Portiforo
and his villainous associates have cause to suspect
that their infamous secret is known, they will
doubtless make short work of their victim. As the
señora says, our only hope lies in our ability to continue
to make them believe that nobody—not even she—is
aware of the truth regarding our martyr president.”</p>

<p>Hawley looked at him in surprise. “Do you mean
to say that Portiforo doesn’t know, now, that the
señora suspects the truth?” he demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>“We have strong hopes that such is the case,” the
venerable physician answered. “Señora Felix has been
very clever. I believe, sir, that there are few women
who could have conducted themselves with such rare
tact and courage as she has displayed.” He bowed
reverently to her. “When it becomes possible to let
the truth be known, the story of what this brave little
woman has done will thrill the whole world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“For two years,” he continued, his fine old face
glowing with enthusiasm, “she has submitted patiently
to the badgerings of Portiforo’s spies, who have tried
by every means their ingenuity could devise to ascertain
whether she had any inkling of the monstrous conspiracy.
For two years she has played her difficult part
with consummate skill, listening with a silence that was
truly sublime to the sneers and abuse that were heaped
upon her husband, stifling the impulses of her tortured
soul, which yearned to cry out to the whole world that
Felix was a martyr, instead of a rascal. For two years
she has hung her head in shame, pretending, for the
edification of Portiforo’s spies, that she believed herself
to be the deserted wife of an absconder—that the
letters she received from him after his disappearance
were genuine.”</p>

<p>“The letters?” the Camera Chap exclaimed wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Bonsal, somewhat
confused; “perhaps I should not have spoken of them.”
He turned inquiringly to the señora.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” the latter reassured him. “Since
Mr. Hawley has been told so much, he might as well
know everything. I know that we can trust him absolutely.
The letters which Doctor Bonsal refers to,”
she herself explained, addressing the Camera Chap,
“are the ones which I have received from my husband
since that fatal night. You remember, perhaps, my
telling you, on board the <em>Colombia</em>, that I had been in
receipt of letters from him?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap nodded. “Forgeries, I suppose?”<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
he suggested. “Of course, President Felix never wrote
them?”</p>

<p>Her reply astonished him greatly. “I believe he did
write them,” she said. “They might be forgeries very
skillfully done, but I think not. I am almost positive
that they are in his own handwriting.”</p>

<p>Hawley stared at her in bewilderment. “But I don’t
quite understand, señora. You can’t mean that they’ve
actually permitted him to communicate with you?”</p>

<p>“Not permitted—forced him to do so!” rejoined the
woman, her dark eyes flashing. “If those notes are
genuine, they must have been written under compulsion.”</p>

<p>“Might I inquire what they said?” the Camera Chap
said eagerly.</p>

<p>The señora sighed. “The first one said merely that
he was alive and well, and that I must not worry. The
others—there have been at least a dozen of them, so
far—were to the same effect, but some of them contained
the additional assurance that he was very
comfortable, and would send for me as soon as he considered
it safe to do so.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap frowned. “How did these notes
come to you, señora?”</p>

<p>“Through the mails.”</p>

<p>“To your Washington address?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They were postmarked Paris, France. That
was the whole object of the diabolical subterfuge—to
make me believe that my husband was over there, at
liberty, living on the proceeds of his crime.”</p>

<p>Doctor Bonsal nodded gravely. “Of course, that<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
was the motive of those notes,” he said, “and the
señora was clever enough to pretend to be completely
deceived by them.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” the Camera Chap exclaimed. Then, as
a thought came to him: “But there is one other question
that I would like to ask. It concerns that chap,
Cipriani, or Rodriguez, whichever his name is. He,
of course, señora, knew the truth about your husband?”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated, and her questioner caught a
swift glance which passed between her and Doctor
Bonsal.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that?” the physician demanded
sharply. “What do you know about Rodriguez, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not very much,” Hawley replied. “I saw, of
course, what happened on the customhouse dock at
Puerto Guerra, the other day, and later, when I arrived
here, I learned from the clerk at the hotel the
significance of what I had witnessed. I was informed
that General Rodriguez had come to Baracoa to start
a revolution.”</p>

<p>Once more a swift glance passed between the old
man and the señora. It was evident to the Camera
Chap that the pair were exceedingly disconcerted by
this turn in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Did—did this hotel clerk say anything which gave
you cause to believe that Rodriguez knew President
Felix’s fate?” Doctor Bonsal stammered. Happening
to glance at the señora, the Camera Chap observed that
her lips were parted, and that her whole attitude indicated
that she awaited his answer with great suspense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he assured them; “the clerk didn’t know
anything about that. You need have no apprehensions
on that score. It was your own actions that day,
señora, which caused me to believe that you were in
sympathy with Cipriani’s venture. I was standing
close beside you at the ship’s rail, and I couldn’t help
observing how greatly you were agitated by what occurred
on shore. And then, there was the note you
sent me later. From these things I got the impression
that Cipriani was working for you—that his revolution
was started with the object of getting President
Felix out of El Torro.”</p>

<p>Doctor Bonsal glanced nervously toward the window,
the shades of which were drawn. “Not so loud,
señor, I beg of you,” he whispered. “If a mere hint
of what you have just said should reach our enemies,
we are done for. Tell me, have you expressed this
theory of yours to anybody else?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” the Camera Chap replied indignantly.
“Pardon me, doctor, but your question is almost
a reflection on my intelligence.”</p>

<p>The señora uttered an audible sigh of relief. “We
might have known that we could rely upon Mr. Hawley’s
discretion,” she said. Then, addressing the Camera
Chap: “No doubt you can surmise the reason for
our great apprehension?”</p>

<p>Hawley smiled. “I think I can. The government
believes that Rodriguez’s revolution had nothing whatever
to do with your cause. Isn’t that the idea?”</p>

<p>The señora nodded. “We took every care to convey
that impression,” she said sadly. “As Doctor Bonsal<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
has said, if Portiforo had any suspicion of our noble
friend’s real motive, the consequences would be fatal—as
fatal as if you were to persist in your efforts to
get into El Torro to photograph my husband.”</p>

<p>“And that reminds me,” said Doctor Bonsal, with
a smile, “we have wandered away from the subject we
were discussing. I trust, Mr. Hawley, that you will
find it convenient to sail on the <em>Panama</em> to-morrow?”</p>

<p>A look of distress came to the Camera Chap’s face.
“I am sorry, but I’m afraid I cannot do that,” he said
regretfully. “I would like to oblige you, señora, but
you must appreciate my position. Even if I were willing
to quit, I would not be free to consult my own
wishes in the matter, or even yours. I am here under
orders—orders that must be carried out before I can
think of leaving Baracoa.”</p>

<p>Señora Felix’s face became very stern. “Surely you
and your president would not sacrifice a human life
in order to gratify your selfish ambitions!” she exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Selfish ambitions!” Hawley protested. “Oh, come
now, señora; that’s scarcely a fair way of putting it.”</p>

<p>“It is fair!” she rejoined passionately. “For you
this adventure, if successful, simply means one more
feather in your cap—one more triumph to be added to
your roll of journalistic achievements. For your president
it means a diplomatic victory scored—a chance to
replace the present administration of Baracoa with one
more favorable to the policies of the United States
government. And for these reasons you are determined
to go ahead now, regardless of the inevitable<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
consequences which have been so clearly pointed out
to you. What other term can I use to characterize your
motive than selfish ambition?”</p>

<p>“But, my dear señora,” argued the Camera Chap,
with an uneasy feeling that there might be some justice
in her viewpoint, “we can’t let President Felix
remain in El Torro. Wouldn’t that be almost as bad
as death itself? There may be a certain amount of
risk to my plan, but I feel confident that if the matter
could be put up to your husband he would be willing
to run the chance of having me go ahead. You see,
there isn’t any other way of getting him out. If there
were, I might be willing to give up my attempt. If a
better plan——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an exclamation from the
woman, and again he detected an interchange of swift
glances between her and Doctor Bonsal.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that, sir?” the latter demanded
eagerly. “Have we your word for it that if you knew
that another plan was under way, you would abandon
this undertaking and sail for New York on the <em>Panama</em>
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“If it was a better way than mine,” Hawley stipulated
guardedly. “I’d have to be convinced of that,
of course.”</p>

<p>The physician flashed a glance of interrogation at
the señora, who answered him with a nod. “We have
put ourselves so much in your confidence already, Mr.
Hawley,” he said quietly, “that we might as well go
a little further. I know that we can trust you.” He
glanced nervously toward the shaded window, and<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
lowered his voice to a whisper. “We have important
tidings,” he announced. “General Rodriguez made his
escape to-day from the arsenal, and is now at liberty.
You realize what that means?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled faintly. “Another revolution,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the old man fervently. “And this time
one that will not fail. So you see, sir, there is a much
more practical plan than the one you are now abandoning.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A SERIOUS CHARGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A knock on the door of the room interrupted the
conversation at this point, and startled Doctor Bonsal
and his guests. It was only the old black servant who
had admitted Hawley to the house. He handed his
employer an envelope. “Your pardon for interrupting,
master,” he whispered, “but it is from the hospital
and you said it should be brought to you at once.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Pedro,” the physician responded
eagerly tearing open the envelope. As he read its contents
he uttered a joyous exclamation.</p>

<p>“Here is good news,” he said, turning to the
señora. “This is from my good friend Doctor Picard.
He tells me that an operation has just been performed
on General Replife, and the bullet removed.
It had lodged in the chest, narrowly missing the heart.
Doctor Picard says that the minister of war’s condition
is still very grave, but there is no immediate cause for
alarm. It will be several weeks before he will be out
of danger, but he has a fighting chance of pulling
through.”</p>

<p>“Thank God,” the woman murmured fervently.
“There is hope now—unless that which we dread has
already happened,” she added, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Of course it hasn’t!” declared Doctor Bonsal reassuringly.
“You can depend upon it that Portiforo
wouldn’t dare take extreme measures until he was quite<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
sure that Replife wasn’t going to get well and call him
to account. He will await the result of the minister
of war’s injuries. And, in the meantime, our dearest
hopes may be realized. Doctor Picard tells us that
even though Replife’s injuries prove fatal, he may linger
for several weeks—and within that time much may
happen,” he added significantly.</p>

<p>He turned eagerly to the Camera Chap. “I trust,
sir, that if anything was lacking before to convince
you of the necessity of giving up your venture, this
will remove your last doubt. We have, now, new reason
to hope that the life of our beloved president will
be spared for some days. Portiforo will not take
any desperate step unless he is spurred on to do so
by the fear that his secret has leaked out. We can
truly say that our fate lies in your hands, and we throw
ourselves upon your generosity.”</p>

<p>“And upon your sense of honor as well,” the señora
supplemented quickly. “You gave us your promise,
Mr. Hawley, that if we could assure you that we had
a plan more promising than yours, you would leave
Baracoa immediately.”</p>

<p>“But I am not sure that your plan is more promising
than mine,” Hawley replied, with a smile. “Don’t
think that I’m trying to evade you, but I must remind
you that your friend Rodriguez has tried his revolution
once and failed. What guarantee have we that
he will succeed this time? And even if he does make
good with his revolution, how is he going to get President
Felix out of El Torro? I don’t see why there
wouldn’t be just the same objection to his plan as to<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
mine. The revolutionists may capture the fortress,
but——” He paused significantly.</p>

<p>The señora was about to make a reply when there
came a startling interruption. Pedro, the aged servitor,
who had departed from the room after delivering
Doctor Picard’s note, now came rushing in, without
going through the formality of knocking. He was
in a state of great excitement. His eyes were rolling,
and his face was almost white.</p>

<p>“Master,” he gasped, “the house is surrounded by
soldiers. There are two of them knocking at the front
door now.”</p>

<p>A faint cry of alarm escaped from the señora. She
seemed to be on the verge of collapse. Doctor Bonsal’s
face had turned very pale, and the Camera Chap saw
that he was shaking as though suddenly seized with a
chill. His lips moved as though he were about to
speak, but no words came from them.</p>

<p>Hawley, the only cool member of the group, was
the first to break the silence. “Pardon me for suggesting
it, doctor,” he said, as a sound of a violent
pounding came to his ears, “but wouldn’t it be a good
idea to find out what those fellows want? From the
way they are going at it, if you don’t answer them
pretty soon, they’ll have the door in splinters.”</p>

<p>The physician made a heroic attempt to pull himself
together. “I think I know what they want, without
asking them,” he said, with a grim smile. “But you
are right; nothing is to be gained by keeping them
waiting. I will go and attend to them.”</p>

<p>He made a step toward the door, but the señora<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
intercepted him. “Not you!” she protested frantically.
“You must not go to them. It is for you that they
have come. You must find some way of escaping from
the house.”</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders. “I’m afraid
that won’t be possible, my dear friend,” he replied, now
quite calm. “Did you not say, Pedro, that the house
was surrounded by soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, master,” the panic-stricken servant replied.
“The garden is full of them. There are more than
twenty of them, and they have every means of escape
covered.”</p>

<p>Doctor Bonsal turned with a sad smile to Señora
Felix: “You see! To attempt flight would be useless.
Besides, even if it were possible for me to get away,
it would be most unwise. It is necessary that I go to
those men at the door before they come in here. It is
our only chance of preventing them from discovering
the presence here of you and Mr. Hawley—and that,
of course, must be prevented.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot let you go,” the señora cried, still
clinging to him. “It means your doom. That tyrant
will show you no mercy. You——”</p>

<p>“Hush, my child,” he said gently. “After all, I
am an old man, and my days upon this earth are numbered.
It does not matter much what becomes of me—we
must think only of the cause that is so dear to
us. If only we can get those men to depart without
learning that you are here, I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>He gently disengaged himself from her grasp, and
turned to the Camera Chap. “Whatever happens, Mr.<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
Hawley, I am going to ask you to remain in this room
with Señora Felix, and not attempt to leave the house
until you have made sure that the soldiers have gone.
I would try to conceal you both, but there is no time
for that. Besides, it would be useless; if they insist
upon searching the house they would find you anyway,
and——”</p>

<p>A crash and a shout of triumph interrupted him.
“They’ve broken down the door. I must go at once,”
he whispered, and hurried out into the hall.</p>

<p>“What do you wish, gentlemen? What is the meaning
of this violence?” the Camera Chap heard him
demand, with great dignity.</p>

<p>“You are Doctor Gaspard Bonsal?”</p>

<p>“At your service, señor.”</p>

<p>“We have an order for your arrest,” came the
startling announcement. “I regret to say, señor, that
you must go with us at once.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap made an impulsive move toward
the door, but Señora Felix stopped him with an imploring
gesture. “You can do nothing,” she whispered,
the tears streaming down her face. “I beg of
you not to make matters worse by interfering.”</p>

<p>“But what does it mean?” Hawley demanded.
“Why are they arresting that——”</p>

<p>“Listen!” the woman interrupted tensely.</p>

<p>“I am at your service, gentlemen,” they heard the
venerable physician say again. “But might I inquire
the nature of the charge against me?”</p>

<p>“You are accused of aiding and abetting General
Rodriguez to escape from the arsenal prison,” came<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
the grim reply. “If you are innocent, doctor, you
have no cause to fear. You will have a fair trial.”</p>

<p>“Very good, señor,” exclaimed the aged man, his
voice trembling. “I am ready to go with you.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap, an expression of astonishment
on his face, turned to the señora. “Is it true?” he
whispered.</p>

<p>She nodded, and, sinking into a chair, covered her
face with her hands. Then, suddenly, she jumped to
her feet, and stood quivering like a hunted animal as
another voice reached them: “How about searching
the premises before we go, captain?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap glanced almost instinctively toward
the heavy portières which draped the window.
They did not offer a very promising chance of concealment
for himself and the señora, but they appeared
to be the best that the room offered. Fortunately,
however, it did not come to that. He and the woman
exchanged a glance of congratulation as they heard the
man addressed as captain reply carelessly: “No; we
need not bother to search the house. We had no orders
to do so. All we want is our prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to accompany you, gentlemen,” said
Doctor Bonsal.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A NEW MENACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mindful of the warning which Doctor Bonsal had
given him, Hawley made sure that none of the soldiers
had remained behind to watch the house before
he ventured to leave the ill-starred physician’s residence.
When he was satisfied that the coast was
clear, he and Señora Felix went through the garden at
the rear of the house, and out of a small gate, thus
making their departure as unobtrusively as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as they were outside, Hawley and the señora
parted company, the woman entering an automobile
with a closed top which had been standing in readiness
for her on a quiet road a short distance from the
garden gate.</p>

<p>“Remember your promise! I shall expect to hear
to-morrow that you have sailed on the <em>Panama</em>,” were
her parting words to him, and before he could make
any reply she was gone.</p>

<p>Hawley felt that this was taking an unfair advantage
of him, inasmuch as the promise which he had given
had been a tentative one. He was not sure, though,
that he was not going to return to New York the following
day as she desired; for the arguments which
he had heard, and the stirring events of that evening,
had made such an impression on him that he was seriously
thinking of giving up the undertaking.</p>

<p>The thought of returning to the White House with<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
a report of failure was not a pleasant one, but he
wished to do what was right in the matter. The bitter
remark of Señora Felix that selfish ambition was the
sole motive of his mission to Baracoa had got under
his skin. Being an exceedingly fair-minded man, he
could not help asking himself whether there was not
some justice in her accusation.</p>

<p>The President of the United States had not taken
him into his confidence as to what he purposed to
do in the event of the Camera Chap’s being successful
in getting the photographic evidence of Portiforo’s
rascality. He had instructed Hawley merely to get
the picture and bring it to the White House, giving
no hint of what measures he intended to employ to
prevent Portiforo from wreaking summary vengeance
on his victim. Hawley knew that the present incumbent
of the White House was a man of but scant sentiment,
and he could not help wondering whether the
great man, satisfying his conscience with the argument
that individuals could not be considered when
public policy was concerned, was not ruthlessly willing
to sacrifice poor President Felix in order to bring
about the exposure of Portiforo and a welcome change
in the administration of Baracoa.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the Camera Chap was reluctant
to believe that this could be his distinguished
employer’s attitude. However lacking the President
of the United States might be in sentiment, he had
the reputation of being an eminently just man. Besides,
was not Señora Felix the intimate friend of the
wife of a member of his cabinet? Which made it very<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
unlikely that the president would have taken this step
unless he had up his sleeve some plan for protecting
President Felix from the murderous impulses of the
conspirators.</p>

<p>These conflicting thoughts left the Camera Chap
in a very unsettled frame of mind. He conscientiously
sought to put aside his own wishes in the matter. As
the señora had bitterly stated, it would be a great
feather in his cap to get that picture—the most notable
achievement of his whole career; but he was prepared
to give it up, provided he was satisfied that such a
course would be for the best, so far as Felix was concerned.
For the martyr of El Torro was the only man
to be considered. The Camera Chap was fully resolved
as to that. If the photographic evidence of the
monstrous conspiracy could not be obtained without
fatal results to the victim, it would be better, he decided,
to leave things as they were.</p>

<p>Deep in thought as he wrestled with this problem,
Hawley was walking along the Avenida Juarez on his
way back to the hotel, when he encountered two men
coming arm in arm up the street toward him. One of
this pair, who wore the uniform of an army officer,
staggered as he walked as though under the influence
of liquor. The other, a good-looking, dapper young
American, was in civilian clothes, and displayed no
outward evidence of being in the same condition as
his companion.</p>

<p>The sight of these two together was a startling surprise
to the Camera Chap; for the dapper young
American was Gale, of the <cite>News</cite>, and the man who<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
staggered was Captain Ernesto Reyes, of the engineers’
corps, in command of the prison guard of El
Torro.</p>

<p>Hawley had not as yet met Reyes. Although, when
Virginia Throgmorton had first mentioned the army
captain, he had registered a resolve to make the latter’s
acquaintance as soon as possible, he had since
changed his mind as to the wisdom of such a step. It
had suggested itself to his imagination that situations
might subsequently arise wherein it would be an advantage
not to be recognized by the custodian of El
Torro prison; so, instead of seeking his acquaintance,
Hawley had cautiously avoided him. But he knew
Reyes by sight, and was quite sure, now, of the identity
of Gale’s companion.</p>

<p>Until this moment he had been unaware that Captain
Reyes and the <cite>News</cite> man were acquainted. The
discovery that they not only knew each other, but, apparently,
were boon companions, came as a shock to
him. He wondered uneasily whether it was a mere
coincidence, or whether Gale had reasons of his own
for getting into the good graces of the man who had
charge of President Felix.</p>

<p>He was not left long in doubt on this point. Before
he had a chance to dodge, Gale recognized him, and,
tugging at the arm of his staggering companion, came
quickly toward him.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t an odd thing, I’d like to know
what is,” he began exuberantly. “I mean our meeting
you right here and now, Hawley, old scout. Strangest
thing that’s happened to me in a dog’s age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see anything so very remarkable about it,”
replied Hawley, noting that although Gale was steady
on his feet, there was a thickness in his voice that was
not normal. “San Cristobal is not a very large city,
and the Avenida Juarez is one of its principal thoroughfares;
so what is so strange about our meeting
here?”</p>

<p>“Because we were just this minute talking about
you, old pal,” Gale explained, “and my old college
chum, here, was saying how much he would like
to meet you. Isn’t that right, Ernesto?”</p>

<p>Captain Reyes blinked his eyes rapidly and murmured
something which was so unintelligible that the
Camera Chap couldn’t even tell whether it was English
or Spanish.</p>

<p>“You were talking about me?” exclaimed Hawley,
his eyes fixed searchingly on the <cite>News</cite> man’s flushed
face. “That’s very flattering. May I inquire in what
way I figured in your conversation?”</p>

<p>Gale chuckled. “I was explaining to my friend here
what you are doing in Baracoa,” he said. “And why
you spend so much of your time hanging around
Puerto Cabero.”</p>

<p>Splendid as was his usual self-possession, Hawley
was unable to refrain from giving a start of surprise
at this announcement. But he was quickly on his
guard. “That was very kind of you,” he said pleasantly.
“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p>Gale grinned. “I told him about the work you hope
to do with your little camera.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap raised his eyebrows interrogatively.<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” the <cite>News</cite> man rejoined, with an
ironical laugh. “See here, Hawley, what’s the sense
of our playing hide and seek with each other any
longer? Wouldn’t it be a much more sensible idea for
us to get together on this assignment? I need you and
you need me, so what’s the matter with forming a
partnership?”</p>

<p>“A partnership to do what?”</p>

<p>Gale’s reply made him wince. “To find old boy
Felix, of course,” the <cite>News</cite> man exclaimed boisterously.</p>

<p>“To find Felix!” the Camera Chap repeated, with
well-simulated bewilderment.</p>

<p>Gale laughed raucously. “Still keeping up the bluff,
eh? Don’t you suppose that I know what you’re here
for? I must admit that you had me guessing at first,
but as soon as I got that query from my office, I was
wise right away. I knew then that we were both following
up the same tip.” He chuckled. “Thought you
were going to have it exclusive, eh? Well, as I’ve
often told you before, the <cite>Sentinel</cite> will have to get up
mighty early in the morning to get ahead of the good
old <cite>News</cite>.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re telling me more than you ought
to,” said the Camera Chap, making a valiant attempt
to conceal his uneasiness. “You’ll be sorry to-morrow
for slipping me these hints about this mysterious tip
of yours.”</p>

<p>The other grinned. “You think I’m feeling so good<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
that I don’t realize what I’m doing, eh? Well, you’re
mistaken about that. I wouldn’t be mentioning anything
about Felix, now, if I wasn’t quite sure that
I’m not slipping you anything that you don’t know.”
He put his hand in his coat pocket. “Just to prove to
you how sure I am that you and I are shinning up the
same tree, I’ll show you the telegram I got from
the office.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” the Camera Chap protested hastily,
with an involuntary glance toward the swaying figure
of Captain Reyes.</p>

<p>But the <cite>News</cite> man went on fumbling in his pocket.
“Can’t seem to find it,” he muttered thickly. “Wonder
what the deuce I’ve done with it.” Then his face
lighted up. “By Jove! I remember now. Can’t show
you the query the office sent me about Felix being
locked up in El Torro, Hawley, old scout, because I
haven’t got it. I left it with old boy Portiforo.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap stared at him incredulously.
“You did what?”</p>

<p>“I left it with his nibs, the President of Baracoa.
Ernesto and I have been dining with him at the palace
this evening. That’s why we’re feeling so good now.
His bubble water was the best I’ve ever sampled.
Some class to your little friend Gale—dining with
presidents and cabinet ministers.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize what you’re saying?” Hawley demanded
sharply. “You can’t really mean that you
showed Portiforo the tip you got from your office.
You’re too level-headed, I’m sure, to do a fool thing
like that. It must be the wine that makes you tell me<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
such nonsense. Come, pull yourself together, Gale,
and talk sense.”</p>

<p>“I am talking sense,” Gale replied, with a show of
indignation. “Sure I showed Portiforo the telegram.
What was the harm in that? He knew all about the
tip already.”</p>

<p>“He knew about it?” Hawley exclaimed, with an
anxious frown.</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s why he invited me to come and eat
with him. He wanted to pump me as to how much I
knew about this Felix business. You can’t keep anything
from that wise old guy. He’s the slickest article
I’ve ever been up against.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A FORCED PLAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning, Hawley received a note at his
hotel. It was from Virginia Throgmorton, and it
said:</p>

<p>“I must see you at once. Something very alarming
has happened. I am going out riding this afternoon,
as usual. Will you meet me at the same place? If
you can’t be there tell bearer.”</p>

<p>Hawley sent word by the bearer, one of the men-servants
of Minister Throgmorton’s household, that
he would surely be there. The steamship <em>Panama</em>
was due to arrive and leave that afternoon, and if he
kept this appointment he would be unable to sail on
her; but he had already fully decided that he was not
going back to the United States just yet. He hated
to disappoint Señora Felix, but the latest developments
had removed from his mind all doubts as to
what course he should follow.</p>

<p>Virginia Throgmorton’s pretty face wore a very
grave and perturbed expression when Hawley galloped
up to the old trysting place on the steed he had hired
for the occasion. “I don’t think I was followed,” she
began, “but if I was it can’t be helped. I have some
news so important and serious that I had to run the
risk of meeting you once more.”</p>

<p>“Is it about our friend Gale?” the Camera Chap inquired,
having a shrewd suspicion of the cause of the
girl’s anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; how did you guess—or do you know about
that dinner last night?”</p>

<p>“I know a little about it, I think,” Hawley answered.
“I met Gale last evening on Avenida Juarez, as he was
returning from the palace, and he told me that he had
been President Portiforo’s guest at dinner.”</p>

<p>A shade flitted across the girl’s face. “Did he tell
you what took place at that dinner?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap nodded grimly.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” exclaimed Virginia, in a tone
of deep concern. “Poor Señora Felix! I fear that
all her brave efforts to save her husband have been in
vain. Now that Portiforo knows that the press of
the United States is aware of his secret, he will take
no chances. In order to avert discovery he will resort
to desperate measures.”</p>

<p>“The situation is pretty bad,” Hawley admitted.
“Still, it might be worse, I think. I’ve been doing a
lot of thinking since I met Gale last night, and I believe
I’ve hit upon a way of lulling Portiforo into a sense
of false security.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” the girl demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>“I understand, from what Gale told me last evening,”
the Camera Chap explained, “that Portiforo invited
him to dinner for the double purpose of finding
out how much he knew, and denying vehemently that
there was any truth in the rumor. Now, my idea is
that if Gale can be made to believe that Portiforo
spoke the truth—that there is absolutely nothing in
the rumor of President Felix’s confinement in El
Torro, he will wire his paper to that effect, the <cite>News</cite><span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
will publish the story, knocking the supposed lie on the
head; the story will be cabled back to San Cristobal,
and Portiforo will be satisfied that he has nothing to
fear from the press of the United States.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to make Mr. Gale believe
Portiforo’s denial?” Virginia queried. “He doesn’t
believe it now. He was arguing with father about
it at the breakfast table this morning. He said that
Portiforo was very crafty—that he couldn’t fool him,
but that he intended to keep right on until he got the
proof.”</p>

<p>“And what did Mr. Throgmorton say to that?”
Hawley inquired, greatly interested.</p>

<p>“Dad got angry and said that he had given Mr.
Gale credit for having more sense. He asserted that
Portiforo was a most estimable gentleman, and the
best president that had ever ruled over Baracoa, and
that this preposterous rumor about Felix was a base
slander concocted by the enemies of the present administration.
Dad asked Mr. Gale about his visit
to El Torro fortress. It seems that Mr. Gale went
all through the prison the other day, on a pass from
the minister of war. Dad wanted to know how he had
been treated there. Mr. Gale said that he had been
received very cordially, that Captain Reyes had taken
him all over the prison, and that he had discovered
nothing to confirm his suspicions.”</p>

<p>“Then he didn’t see the cell with the covered door?”
Hawley remarked.</p>

<p>“Evidently not; at least, he didn’t mention it. Still,
he is far from satisfied. He argued with father that<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
the prison officials knew he was coming, and could
easily have removed President Felix before he got
there. So you see, Mr. Hawley,” Virginia pointed
out, “we would have a hard time trying to make him
believe that there is nothing in the story.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled. “I think I have found a
way of convincing him,” he said quietly. “In order
to carry out my plan, Miss Throgmorton, I shall need
your assistance.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to outline his plan, and Virginia’s
face lighted up as she listened. “Excellent!” she exclaimed.
“You can certainly count on me to do my
part.”</p>

<p>“And Señora Felix? Do you think you will be able
to persuade her to let us have those letters?”</p>

<p>“I feel sure that she will consent,” the girl replied.
“She doesn’t know yet of Mr. Gale’s interview with
Portiforo. When she hears of it, she will be willing
to do anything in her power to avert this new menace.
And she is bound to be impressed with your ingenious
plan. It was really very clever of you to think of it,
Mr. Hawley, and I want to thank you for making my
heart much lighter than it was when I came out here.
I felt, then, that all was lost.”</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, her face clouded. “But, after all,”
she said sadly, “even though we succeed in reassuring
Portiforo, that isn’t getting poor President Felix out
of prison.” She looked at the Camera Chap wistfully.
“Don’t you think that you’ll soon be able to find a way
of getting that picture, Mr. Hawley?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled. “I am going to whisper<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
a little secret,” he said; “I believe I have found a way
already. I was out in the harbor in the motor boat
this morning, taking another peep at El Torro, and,
suddenly, an inspiration came to me as to how the
thing might be done. It is a good plan, and I feel
confident that it would succeed; but in order to carry
it out, I shall have to find a partner—preferably a
woman.”</p>

<p>“Preferably a woman!” Virginia caught him up
eagerly. “Well, you won’t have to look very far, Mr.
Hawley. What’s the matter with me?”</p>

<p>“You!” he exclaimed, as though the thought had
never even remotely suggested itself to him. “Do you
mean to say that you’re ready to volunteer, Miss
Throgmorton, without even knowing what the job
calls for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what it calls for,” she responded, her
eyes flashing. “If there’s anything that I can do to
help get poor President Felix free, I’m eager to do it.
Won’t you let me help you, Mr. Hawley?”</p>

<p>“I’ll consider your application,” he replied gravely.
“That’s the best I can promise now. But, first, we
must attend to the business of getting rid of Gale.
We can’t do anything until we’ve made him believe
that President Felix isn’t in El Torro.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">WHAT GALE OVERHEARD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The morning after his dinner with President Portiforo
found Gale in a very unsettled frame of mind.
Save for a severe headache, he had fully recovered
from the effects of the elaborate banquet which the
President of Baracoa had given in his honor, and he
retained a clear recollection of the conversation which
had passed between him and his host. It was that
conversation which now puzzled him.</p>

<p>Portiforo had discussed the startling rumor about
Felix with, apparently, the utmost frankness. In fact,
it was he himself who had broached the subject. Over
the cigars and coffee he had surprised Gale by abruptly
inquiring, with a quizzical smile, how that young man
was getting along in his quest for the missing President
Baracoa. Quickly recovering his self-possession,
the reporter had attempted to deny that he was interested
in any such quest. Then Portiforo had
laughed, and told him that he might as well own up,
as he was fully aware of the real cause of Gale’s
recent tour of inspection through El Torro fortress.</p>

<p>Later on, it occurred to the <cite>News</cite> man how the president
had probably come into possession of this information.
Stephens, his managing editor, had sent him
the assignment by wire, and it was more than likely
that, in this land, where spying was a fine art, the
government maintained a close surveillance over all
messages that were received and sent from the cable<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
office. But this simple solution of the mystery did
not suggest itself to him immediately, and his perplexity
greatly amused his host.</p>

<p>“But do not fear, my dear Señor Gale, that I am in
the least bit offended by your activities,” the latter had
reassured him. “I realize that you are merely doing
your duty. I must express my amazement, though, at
the credulity of your editor. Surely he must be a
person of scant intelligence, to be deceived by such a
preposterous story.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been deceived by it,” Gale answered. “I
have no doubt, Mr. President, that my editor suspects
there is nothing in the rumor; but, just the same, we
have to investigate it. You would be astonished to
know how many ridiculous tips come into a big newspaper
office—rumors that have not a vestige of fact
behind them. But we investigate them all. We can’t
afford to take any chances. And that is why I have
been instructed to look into this matter.”</p>

<p>The reply had seemed to afford Portiforo much
satisfaction. “It is well,” he said. “Nothing could
please us more than to have this absurd story thoroughly
sifted to the very bottom by a fair-minded,
highly intelligent journalist such as I know you to be—for
I have heard of your worthiness and great skill
from my good friend Señor Throgmorton. We court
investigation. For, while I feel confident that no intelligent
person will give serious consideration to this
heinous fabrication of our enemies, at the same time
it is exceedingly distressing to me and the patriotic and
high-minded gentlemen connected with my administration<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
to have such a rumor circulating in the United
States. Therefore, I am hopeful, my dear Señor Gale,
that before you leave Baracoa you will be in a position
to dispose once and for all of these base calumnies.
You have my assurance that nothing will be done to
impede your efforts.”</p>

<p>Was Portiforo on the level? That was the question
which was perplexing Gale now. He was too
astute and sophisticated a man to be entirely deceived
by the Baracoan president’s air of sincerity, for in
his newspaper work he had been thrown with New
York politicians who had been equally perfervid in declaring
that they “courted investigation,” and experience
had taught him that this wasn’t always to be taken
as a sign of innocence. But the result of his investigations
to date seemed to favor Portiforo. His tour
of inspection through El Torro prison and his skillfully
disguised questioning of the soldiers of the garrison
and many residents of Puerto Cabero and San
Cristobal had failed to unearth a single clew. His
conversations with Captain Reyes, whose friendship
he had managed to cultivate without difficulty, and who
impressed him as being a frank and rather simple-minded
chap, had proved equally unproductive.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was the attitude of Minister Throgmorton.
As Virginia had told the Camera Chap, Gale
had discussed the matter with the United States representative
at the breakfast table that morning, and the
latter had waxed highly indignant at such insinuations
being made against his good friend Portiforo,
who, he declared, was the very soul of honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>Being a pretty good judge of men, the <cite>News</cite> reporter
was not disposed to regard Minister Throgmorton
as one of the most brilliant and keen-witted
diplomats he had ever met; still, he considered it
scarcely likely that Portiforo and his friends could
have got away with such an audacious kidnaping plot
without the American minister knowing something
about it. Therefore, the latter’s faith in the President
of Baracoa went a long way toward influencing Gale’s
judgment.</p>

<p>That afternoon Gale received a second dispatch
from Ben Stephens, his managing editor. It was terse
and to the point. It read:</p>

<p>“Have you dropped dead? If not, why don’t we
hear from you regarding assignment?”</p>

<p>Gale was strongly inclined to wire back that he
had made a thorough and laborious investigation of
the tip and begged to report that somebody had handed
the <cite>News</cite> a large and juicy citron. There was only
one reason why he did not take this step. That reason
was—the Camera Chap. He was afraid that
Hawley might have been more successful than he in
picking up a clew corroborative of President Felix’s
incarceration in El Torro.</p>

<p>Much as he disliked the Camera Chap, he had a
wholesome respect for that wide-awake man’s shrewdness
and ability, and he didn’t deem it safe to throw
down the story until he was sure that his rival was
ready to quit.</p>

<p>So he wired back to Stephens that he was still alive,
and had been working hard on the assignment, but<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
was not yet ready to report. That evening, however,
something occurred which caused him to send another
dispatch.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner, Gale was writing some letters
in the library of the legation when he heard
voices in the garden below.</p>

<p>“You have no right to come here!” he heard a girl
exclaim petulantly. “It was very indiscreet. I must
ask you to go away immediately. If you were discovered
here it might cause a lot of trouble. My
father——”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I had to see you at once,” a man’s
voice broke in. “I have made an important discovery—one
that necessitated an immediate interview with
you, Miss Throgmorton.”</p>

<p>Gale pricked up his ears. Even before he had
heard her name mentioned he had recognized the girl’s
voice. He believed, too, that he knew the identity
of her companion. In order to make sure he switched
off the lights of the room, and, going to the French
window which commanded a view of the garden,
stepped softly onto the balcony.</p>

<p>By the light of the moon he was able to discern the
familiar outline of a tall, slim man who was standing
with his profile turned toward the balcony.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” he heard the girl say fearfully. “Suppose
there should be somebody listening. Every word
you say can be heard in the house. Can you not wait
until some other time to discuss this matter, Mr. Hawley?
Or, if it must be now, let us go to the other end
of the garden. We shall have more privacy there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>Gale waited until they had disappeared, then hurried
down the short flight of steps which led from the
balcony to the grounds, and went in swift but stealthy
pursuit of them. He did not have much difficulty in
locating the pair. They were seated on a rustic bench
beneath a bamboo tree, and the Camera Chap was talking
excitedly in a voice raised above its normal pitch.</p>

<p>“Why did you do it?” Gale heard him ask. “That’s
what I can’t understand. What could have been your
object in trying to make a fool of me.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t tried to make a fool of you, Mr.
Hawley,” Virginia protested meekly.</p>

<p>Hawley received this with an ironical laugh. Gale
was astonished by his demeanor. On Park Row the
Camera Chap enjoyed the enviable reputation of never
having been known to lose his temper. It was said to
be one of the reasons for his success. But now it
was evident that he was far from being in an amiable
mood.</p>

<p>“For three weeks I’ve been hanging around Puerto
Cabero, tying knots in my brain, trying to find a way
of getting inside the fortress, in order to corroborate
that story you told me the first day I met you,” Hawley
said bitterly. “If you don’t call that making a
fool of me, Miss Throgmorton, I’d like to know why.
Perhaps you’d still like me to believe that Felix is
locked up in El Torro?”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t he?” Virginia inquired, a tinge of mockery
in her voice.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he!” echoed Hawley. “As though you didn’t
know! I suppose your subtle friend, the señora, hasn’t<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
taken you into her confidence regarding the letters she
has been receiving from her husband, eh?”</p>

<p>“The letters!” the girl repeated, her voice trembling.
“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>Hawley laughed triumphantly. “I guess you know
what I mean, Miss Throgmorton. I am referring to
the letters which our missing friend, Felix, has been
writing his wife from Paris.”</p>

<p>Gale heard Virginia utter a little cry of dismay.
“Who told you?” she began. Then, as though suddenly
on her guard: “If there are any such letters,
why should you expect me to know about them?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap’s answer caused the eavesdropper
to give a start of astonishment. “Because,” he charged
sternly, “you happen to have those letters in your possession
now. It is no use attempting to deny it, Miss
Throgmorton. If you knew the source of my information
you would realize that. Your friend Señora
Felix handed you the package of correspondence to-day.
She asked you to take care of them for her;
possibly because she was afraid to keep them herself,
for fear that Portiforo’s spies might ransack her
house and find them. At the present moment they are
concealed in a drawer of your desk, tied up with pink
ribbon. You see that I know what I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>“This is most extraordinary!” Virginia exclaimed.
“How could you possibly know—unless—do you combine
burglary with your newspaper work?”</p>

<p>“Not guilty,” Hawley replied. “If you suspect that
I have been near your desk, you are mistaken. Don’t
ask me how I got the information, because that’s a<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
secret I am not at liberty to disclose. We newspaper
men have our own little methods of finding out things.
I give you my word of honor, though, that I haven’t
seen the letters. If I had, perhaps I shouldn’t be here
now.” He suddenly dropped his aggressive manner.
“I haven’t come to reproach you, my dear Miss Throgmorton,
for the way you and your wily friend, the
señora, have deluded me. I have come to talk business
with you.”</p>

<p>“Business!” Gale heard the girl exclaim, with an
inflection of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have come to return good for evil by offering
you a chance to make a nice little sum of pin
money. I might as well be frank with you: The scoop
would be worth a lot to the paper I represent. The
<cite>Sentinel</cite> would pay handsomely for the privilege of
reproducing that correspondence. If you will give me
an opportunity to photograph those letters, and will
promise that no other newspaper man shall see them,
I will——”</p>

<p>What the great newspaper was prepared to offer in
return for such an accommodation Gale did not learn,
for before the sentence was finished he was on his
way back to the house. It had suddenly occurred to
him that there was a delicate little job which required
his immediate attention.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">HOW IT WORKED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Half an hour later, Virginia Throgmorton entered
the legation library and, stepping up to a dainty little
mahogany desk in a corner of the room, opened one
of the drawers and uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>Gale, who was seated at a table in the center of
the room, looked up from the letter he was writing,
and regarded her solicitously. “Anything wrong?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“It was horribly careless of me to leave the key in
the lock,” the girl murmured, as though speaking more
to herself than to the reporter. “Still, I cannot imagine
who could have taken them. It is most mysterious.”</p>

<p>“Lost anything?” Gale asked curiously.</p>

<p>Virginia hesitated. Then, with sudden decision:
“Yes; some letters are missing from my desk—very
important letters.”</p>

<p>“Love letters?” Gale inquired, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” the girl replied coldly. “How long
have you been in this room, Mr. Gale?”</p>

<p>“Not very long. Not more than five minutes, I
should say. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you had noticed anybody tampering
with my desk.”</p>

<p>The reporter smiled deprecatingly. “My dear Virginia!
If I had, don’t you suppose I would have called
them to account?” Suddenly a glint came to his eyes,<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
as an idea occurred to him. “One minute, though!
I think, perhaps, I can solve this mystery for you.
Tell me, were these letters of such a character that
they would be of value to a newspaper?”</p>

<p>Virginia sighed. “They would be of great value to
a newspaper,” she answered, “but——”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I’ve got the answer,” Gale interrupted.
“This morning, as I was coming downstairs,
I encountered a man coming out of this room. He
seemed to be in a great hurry, and it struck me, also,
that he appeared very nervous. I would have stopped
him and demanded what he was doing here, only I
supposed at the time that he had been calling on your
father. After he had gone, though, I discovered that
your father wasn’t in the house. I have no doubt, now,
that it was the chap who stole the letters from your
desk.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t any idea who he was?” Virginia
asked, an odd break in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” Gale answered. “It was the Camera
Chap—Hawley.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” Virginia gasped. “Are you sure,
Mr. Gale?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely so,” he answered. “Even if I hadn’t
seen him,” he added maliciously, “I might have
guessed that the robbery was his work. I know his
methods. That fellow Hawley is so unprincipled, Virginia,
that he’d steal the crutch from a cripple.”</p>

<p>Feeling very well satisfied with himself and his
evening’s work, Gale went out and repaired to a certain<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
café which he knew was the haunt of a man
whom he greatly desired to see.</p>

<p>“I believe you were telling me, the other day,” he
said, when he had found his man, “that you used to
be employed by former President Felix?”</p>

<p>“I was his private secretary,” the other answered.</p>

<p>“Then you ought to be pretty familiar with his handwriting?”</p>

<p>“I know it as well as I do my own.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed the reporter, suddenly producing
a letter. “That being the case, old man, take a good
look at this and let me know whether you recognize
the fist?”</p>

<p>The man studied the script closely, and a look of
astonishment came to his face. “It is Felix’s handwriting!”
he declared positively.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Gale exultantly. “Now, see
here: I’m going to give you a chance to make some
easy money. I’ve got several more of these letters
here, and I want them translated. I understand enough
Spanish to get an idea what they’re about, but I want
a good translation. There’s ten dollars—American
money—in it for you if you want to undertake the
job.”</p>

<p>President Felix’s former secretary nodded eagerly,
and, taking a fountain pen and a notebook, which Gale
handed him, rapidly wrote out an English translation
of the correspondence.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Gale. “You’ll get the ten
dollars in a couple of days—provided you keep quiet<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
about it. I don’t want anybody to know about these
letters just yet.”</p>

<p>The next morning the New York <cite>Daily News</cite> published
on its front page a story which bore the following
heading:</p>

<p class="center">“WIFE HEARS FROM MISSING PRESIDENT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Francisco Felix, Fugitive President of Baracoa,
Sends Wife Cheering Epistles From Gay Paree.—Weird
Rumor Knocked On Head.—<cite>Daily
News</cite> Staff Correspondent at San Cristobal Unearths
Interesting Correspondence Which Proves
Absurdity of Charge that Felix Was Victim of
Portiforo Conspiracy.”</p>
</div>

<p>This, of course, did not escape the eagle eye of
the New York correspondent of the San Cristobal
<cite>Herald</cite>, whose chief duty was to go through each issue
of the New York newspapers and pick out all stories
which were likely to be of interest to the citizens of
Baracoa. Thus it came about that five hours after
that issue of the <cite>Daily News</cite> appeared on the streets
of New York, the first edition of the San Cristobal
<cite>Herald</cite>, with the same story, under a New York date
line, spread all over its front page, was selling like
hot cakes in the streets of the capital of Baracoa.</p>

<p>At about the same time a lengthy dispatch in cipher
from the Baracoan consulate at New York arrived at
the executive palace. It ended as follows:</p>

<p>“Upon investigation, I have the honor to report that
this morning’s article in the <cite>News</cite>, one of the most influential
newspapers in the United States, has made a<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
great impression upon the American people. There is
already heard both here and in Washington considerable
criticism of the President of the United States
for having permitted a member of his cabinet to show
such conspicuous friendship for the wife of Felix.
Now that the woman’s guilty knowledge of her husband’s
whereabouts has been proved, it is felt by the
better class of citizens here, that the United States has
been placed in an embarrassing position by the fact
that while she was residing at the home of the United
States attorney general she was in constant receipt of
letters from the fugitive.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to report, also, that I am reliably
informed that in addition to publishing its sensational
story, the <cite>News</cite> has cabled secret instructions
to its staff correspondent in Paris to begin immediately
a search for Felix. The editor believes that the
clews furnished by the postmark of the letters ought
to make it an easy matter to find him.”</p>

<p>That President Portiforo was not exactly vexed by
this information was evident when he appeared in
public later that day. As he rode through the streets
in an open carriage, the people were able to get a good
view of his features, and it was noted that he wore
a grin broader than any that had appeared on his
moonlike countenance since the day of his inauguration.</p>

<p>“I saw him this afternoon—I was walking along the
Avenida Bolivar when the presidential equipage rolled
past—and his expression reminded me of the cat just
after swallowing the canary,” the Camera Chap remarked<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
laughingly to Virginia Throgmorton, whom
he met by appointment that afternoon at the usual
trysting place. “It looks as if our little ruse had the
desired effect.”</p>

<p>“It was tremendously clever of you to think of it,
Mr. Hawley,” the girl said enthusiastically. “Your
ingenuity in all probability has saved President Felix’s
life. It isn’t likely that Portiforo will feel so much
like resorting to desperate measures now.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope not,” Hawley responded quietly.</p>

<p>Something in his tone caused the girl to regard him
with great concern. “Has anything happened to make
you believe the contrary?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the Camera Chap answered, with
a frown. “I heard a report at the Red Cross Hospital
this afternoon which I don’t like. They say
there that General Replife, the minister of war, has
suffered a relapse, and is not expected to live another
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“And you think,” said Virginia fearfully, “that if
Replife dies Portiforo may decide that it would suit
his purposes to get rid of poor President Felix despite
the reassuring news from New York?”</p>

<p>Hawley shrugged his shoulders. “At all events, it
will be as well for us not to take any chances,” he said
quietly. “You remember that plan for getting the
picture that I was telling you about yesterday, Miss
Throgmorton? Well, the time has come to carry it
out. Under the circumstances we cannot afford to delay
any longer.” He lowered his voice. “I have decided
to make the attempt to-night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">HIS PLAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I have decided to make the attempt to-night,” the
Camera Chap repeated, looking earnestly at the daughter
of the American minister to Baracoa. “The more
I think about my scheme, the more convinced I am
of its practicability.”</p>

<p>“And you will take me as your assistant?” Virginia
inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>Hawley hesitated. “Well, I don’t know about that.
There would be some danger, and I don’t feel like letting
you run any risk. Of course,” he added wistfully,
“the danger wouldn’t be so very great. No matter how
the venture should turn out, I don’t think they would
dare to harm you. The fact that you are a woman,
and the daughter of the United States minister, ought
to be——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the danger,” the plucky girl broke in
impatiently. “As I told you yesterday, nothing could
please me more than to have a chance to help my unhappy
friends, Señora Felix and her husband. I’d
gladly make any sacrifice for them. I shall hold you to
your promise, Mr. Hawley. As a man of your word,
you’ve got to take me with you.”</p>

<p>Hawley laughed. “I don’t think I quite promised;
I merely said that I would consider your application,
Miss Throgmorton. However, I guess I’ve got to
take advantage of your kind offer. I’ve got to have<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
an assistant, and, while a man might do, a woman
partner would add greatly to the chances of success—especially
when she is beautiful enough to——”</p>

<p>Virginia stopped him with a gesture of disapproval.
“This is no time for frivolous compliments, Mr. Hawley,”
she said severely, a faint tinge of pink making
itself evident beneath her fair skin. “There is too
much at stake for that.”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I had no intention of being frivolous,
Miss Throgmorton—or of paying you compliments,
either,” the Camera Chap explained hastily.
“It is a fact that I am counting a great deal on your
good looks as an asset in this venture.”</p>

<p>Virginia appeared somewhat mollified by this explanation.
“Tell me your plan, Mr. Hawley,” she requested.
“Now that it is settled that I am to have
a part in it, isn’t it only fair that you should take me
into your confidence as to what you’re going to do?”</p>

<p>“It surely is,” Hawley agreed. “I was going to tell
you all about it, anyway, only I deemed it advisable
to keep the details to myself until I was ready to carry
it out.</p>

<p>“It is very simple,” he continued, his face lighting
up. “In fact, I can’t understand why the idea didn’t
hit me long ago. The inspiration came to me like a
flash, the other day, as I was cruising in the motor
boat in the vicinity of El Torro, watching the sentry
pacing up and down outside the window of Felix’s
cell, and tying bowknots in my brain trying to conceive
of a way of getting rid of him. That’s been the
big problem all along, of course—how to get past the<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
sentry. If I could devise a way of luring him from his
post for a few minutes, it would be a simple matter to
get my snapshot of Felix in his cell.”</p>

<p>“And you have found a way of doing that?” the girl
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I believe I have. All that we’ve got to do is to take
a tip from the New York underworld.”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at him in bewilderment, but when
she heard the plan he unfolded, she uttered an exclamation
of delight. “It does sound good!” she declared.
“You are absolutely the most ingenious man I have
ever met.”</p>

<p>Hawley regarded her quizzically. “This is no time
for frivolous compliments, Miss Throgmorton,” he
said, with mock indignation. “There is too much at
stake for that.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed at the way he had turned the tables
on her. Then, suddenly, her smooth brow puckered
into a puzzled frown. “But there is one thing about
your plan which I don’t quite understand,” she told
him. “How do you expect to make your escape from
the fortress after you get the snapshot? You cannot,
of course, use the same boat I’m going to use, and it
seems to me that a second boat would be out of the
question.”</p>

<p>“Of course it would,” her companion agreed.
“There’s only one way that I can see of solving that
difficulty: Since I can’t travel on the water, I shall
have to travel in it.”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at him in horrified amazement.<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
“Surely you’re not thinking of trying to swim back?”
she gasped.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what I’ll have to do,” was the cheerful
reply. “However, there won’t be any trouble
about that. I’m a pretty good swimmer.”</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head. “You must give up that
idea,” she said firmly. “It would be madness. You
couldn’t live ten minutes in those waters, Mr. Hawley.
Don’t you know that Puerto Cabero harbor is full of
sharks?”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, the Camera Chap grew serious
at this announcement. The presence of sharks in the
bay was a detail which had escaped his attention when
he had formulated his plans. The prospect was decidedly
disturbing. Then, suddenly, his face lighted
up. “Oh, well,” he said, with a characteristic shrug,
“I’ve read somewhere that it’s all a fake about sharks
being man-eaters. Anyway, Miss Throgmorton, you’ve
got an exaggerated idea of the situation. I’m not
thinking of swimming the whole width of the bay.
All I’ll have to do is to strike out for the battleship.”</p>

<p>“The battleship?” the girl echoed, her eyebrows
arching.</p>

<p>Hawley laughed. “By Jove! If I haven’t forgotten
to mention the most important detail of all. Evidently
you do not know that the United States battleship
<em>Kearsarge</em> steamed into the harbor this afternoon, and
is now anchored a quarter of a mile off El Torro.
That’s another reason why I feel confident that our
little venture is going to be a success.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">UNDER SEALED ORDERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Although the arrival of the <em>Kearsarge</em> was news to
Virginia, the visit of the huge gray fighting machine
was no surprise to Minister Throgmorton. For some
reason he had failed to mention the matter to his
daughter, but a few days previously he had been officially
notified by the state department at Washington
that the warship was due to arrive in Baracoan waters
on a “friendly visit.”</p>

<p>This information he had formally conveyed to President
Portiforo. The latter was profuse in his expressions
of appreciation of this courtesy. He bade the
representative of the United States assure his government
that a cordial welcome would be given to the
<em>Kearsarge’s</em> officers and crew.</p>

<p>“But what does it mean?” he demanded informally
of his friend Throgmorton. “What purpose has
Washington in view? United States warships have
visited us before, of course, for the reason stated;
but I cannot help entertaining a suspicion that your
government has some special motive in sending a battleship
here at this time.”</p>

<p>To this the United States minister had shrugged his
shoulders. “If there is any such motive, my government
has not seen fit to take me into its confidence
concerning it,” he answered. “However, Mr. President,
if the presence of the <em>Kearsarge</em> in Puerto<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
Cabero harbor is objectionable to you, I am confident
that I have only to notify the state department to that
effect, and Captain Cortrell will receive orders to sail
before the vessel weighs anchor.”</p>

<p>Portiforo, who, with a few exceptions, entertained
a cordial dislike for gringos in general, and the citizens
of the United States in particular, felt a strong
inclination to have this brought about, but he was
diplomat enough not to follow his wishes in the matter.
“I wouldn’t think of being so discourteous to our
sister republic,” he said. “Besides, I have no objection
to the <em>Kearsarge’s</em> visit, provided she does nothing
to disrupt the amity existing between our two nations.
Have you any idea how long she is to stay
here?”</p>

<p>Throgmorton shook his head. “My advices do not
state that,” he said. “If you wish, I can cable Washington
that you would like to be enlightened on that
point.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” the other rejoined hastily. “It
is quite immaterial to me, my dear Throgmorton,
how long she remains. Besides, no doubt her commander
will be able to tell us what his orders are
in that respect.” An anxious expression came to his
face. “What kind of a man is this Captain Cortrell?”
he inquired. “Can you tell me anything about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the most competent officers in the
United States navy,” the minister informed him. “He
was graduated from Annapolis at the head of his class,
and——”</p>

<p>“But his personality?” Portiforo interrupted impatiently.<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
“I don’t care anything about his naval record.
Does he impress you as being a conservative man, or—to
use an expression, of your country—the kind
that would take chances? If you will pardon me for
saying so, I believe that some of your naval officers
have in past instances proved themselves to be somewhat
lacking in discretion and a proper regard for
the niceties of international law.”</p>

<p>“Captain Cortrell is not that kind,” Minister Throgmorton
replied, with a smile. “He has a reputation
for being one of the most cautious and conservative
commanders in our navy, and he knows more international
law than half our statesmen. You need have
no fear, Mr. President, that he will commit any indiscretion
which would disrupt the pleasant relations
existing between our respective governments.”</p>

<p>Somewhat reassured, the President of Baracoa made
preparations to receive the visiting warship with fitting
honors, and the guns of El Torro fortress thundered
a vociferous welcome as the big gray ironclad
steamed up the bay.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap was cruising in the harbor in
his motor boat when the <em>Kearsarge</em> arrived. With
keen interest he watched the colossal fighting machine
come to anchor. A thrill of joy and pride shot through
him as his eyes feasted on her grim gray outline,
and there came to his ears the strains of the ship’s
band crashing out “The Star-spangled Banner.”</p>

<p>Remembering his conversation with the president,
in which the latter had given him clearly to understand
that, win or lose, he could expect no help from<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
the United States government, he felt that he had no
reason to believe that the arrival of the battleship
had anything to do with himself and his mission;
yet he could not help hoping that such was the case—that
something had occurred to change the presidential
mind as to the impossibility of governmental
succor being extended to him. Not that he craved
such protection for himself; he was quite willing to
take his chances, and abide by the consequences of
the adventure; but he was in hopes that the arrival
of the <em>Kearsarge</em> at Puerto Cabero might have something
to do with a plan to protect Felix from Portiforo’s
vengeance. This desire caused him to seek
admission to the battleship almost as soon as she had
dropped anchor.</p>

<p>As he climbed the starboard gangway, a natty young
officer stared hard at him, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but isn’t your name Hawley?”</p>

<p>“It is,” the Camera Chap replied, with a smile.
“And you are Ensign Ridder, unless I am very much
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Ridder,” the other corrected pleasantly,
with some pride. “But I was an ensign the last time
we met. That was three years ago, when I was
attached to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.” His face
broke into a broad grin. “I shall never forget, old
man, how you came to my rescue that night down
in Chinatown, when that gang had me backed up
against the wall, and was——” He stopped short,
suddenly realizing that this was scarcely the time or
place to indulge in personal reminiscences. “I beg your<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
pardon,” he said soberly. “Perhaps you wish to see
somebody on board?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a talk with the captain, if he isn’t
too busy,” the Camera Chap answered.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty busy, but I think he’ll see you,” said
Lieutenant Ridder, emphasizing the pronoun. “As a
matter of fact,” he added, “he’s expecting you.”</p>

<p>“Expecting me!” Hawley echoed, thrilling with joy
as he realized the significance of this announcement.</p>

<p>“He’s given orders that if a man named Hawley
should happen to come aboard, he’s to be taken to
his cabin at once,” the naval officer confided in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed the Camera Chap. “That’s the
best news I’ve heard in a long while.”</p>

<p>Thanks to his acquaintance with Lieutenant Ridder,
the visitor had no trouble in establishing his identity
to the satisfaction of the battleship’s commander.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Mr. Hawley,” the latter
said. Then, abruptly: “I believe you were to bring
a photograph. Have you got it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, captain,” the Camera Chap replied, “but
I expect to get it soon, and——”</p>

<p>The commander of the battleship cut him short
with an impatient gesture. It may have been his
imagination, but Hawley fancied that the expression
on his weather-beaten face was one of keen disappointment.
“My orders say nothing about expectations,
sir,” he said gruffly. “Whenever you get that
snapshot, Mr. Hawley,” he added, “I shall be glad
to see you again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>The Camera Chap did not attempt to ask any questions.
He could tell from the taciturn old sea dog’s
manner that they would not be answered. Besides,
he had found out what he wished to know. From
the reference the captain had made to his orders, he
felt absolutely sure, now, that the arrival of the warship
was more than a coincidence—that the huge mass
of steel, manned by as sturdy a crew as ever trod a
deck, and bristling with guns powerful enough to
smash El Torro fortress to smithereens, and reduce
Puerto Cabero to ruins, was there to help in some way
to right a great wrong.</p>

<p>It was then that he had made up his mind to carry
out that same night the daring plan which he had
afterward described to Virginia Throgmorton. But
he did not tell his fair ally of his visit to the battleship.
There were reasons why he deemed it wise
to keep that incident a secret even from her.</p>

<p>As his visitor walked out of his cabin, Captain
Cortrell took from a drawer of his desk a bulky envelope,
and regarded it with speculative interest.</p>

<p>This envelope was sealed, and Captain Cortrell himself
had never seen its contents. His verbal instructions
were to anchor in Puerto Cabero harbor, and
to remain there until further orders. The sealed envelope
was not to be opened unless he should receive
a visit from a man who could identify himself as a
New York newspaper man named Frank Hawley.
In the event of such an identification being established,
the commander was to demand of his visitor
whether he had brought a certain photograph. If the<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
reply was in the affirmative, and the photograph forthcoming,
Captain Cortrell was then to open the sealed
envelope immediately, and compare the photograph
it contained with the snapshot which his visitor had
brought. If he was satisfied that the original of both
pictures was the same, he was to proceed to carry
out forthwith the written instructions which accompanied
the picture.</p>

<p>What these secret orders were, the commander of
the battleship had not the remotest idea; nor was he
aware whose photograph was inside the envelope. It
was felt by his superiors that there was no need for
him to know these things until the time to act arrived.
He did know, however, that the contents of the envelope
had been placed there by the President of the
United States himself.</p>

<p>Captain Cortrell was not naturally a curious man.
It was largely because the bump of inquisitiveness
was missing from his cranium that he had been selected
for this mysterious mission; but when he had told
his visitor that he was glad to meet him, he had never
in his life spoken more earnestly, for his fingers were
just itching to open that envelope. He had been
wondering greatly, too, what manner of chap this
young man named Hawley must be, that the head
of the nation was willing to go to so much trouble
on his account. It was the first time in his experience
that he had heard of a United States battleship
being dispatched under sealed orders to foreign waters
to aid a newspaper photographer in his work. He
had looked forward with eagerness to the time when<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
the president’s photographic envoy should choose to
put in an appearance. For his instructions did not
permit him to seek the latter out. He must wait until
he came aboard of his own initiative. Evidently it
had been taken for granted at the White House that
the Camera Chap would come to the battleship without
an invitation being extended to him. The logical
mind responsible for these arrangements had foreseen
that in the event of his landing the photographic evidence
of Portiforo’s rascality, it would naturally occur
to him to seek refuge immediately in the safest place
for him within a thousand miles of San Cristobal—the
deck of a ship of war flying the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE SNAPSHOT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The night which Hawley and Virginia had selected
for their assault upon El Torro proved an ideal one
for their purpose; for the moon was obscured most
of the time by a steady procession of dark clouds
which made the waters of the harbor as black as
ink, save for an occasional phosphorescent streak on
the surface of the wavelets, the sight of which made
the girl shudder.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there are many sharks in the bay to-night,”
she whispered fearfully to the Camera Chap,
as he cast loose the painter of the launch, and took
the oars—they had decided to row at the start, instead
of using the motor, for fear that the noise of the
latter might attract attention on shore.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s only your imagination which makes
you think that, Miss Throgmorton,” Hawley responded
cheerfully. “Of course,” he added solicitously,
“if you’re really alarmed, we’ll turn back this
minute; but there’s no danger so far as the sharks are
concerned. They won’t come near the boat.”</p>

<p>Virginia gave him an indignant glance. “Of course,
I know that they won’t come near the boat,” she
said. “Do you suppose that I am scared on my
own account? It was to your danger that I was
referring. I really don’t think that I have any right
to let you do this thing, Mr. Hawley. Much as I<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
would like to see poor President Felix freed, and
my dear friend the señora made happy, it scarcely
seems fair to encourage you to run such a terrible
risk. To think of you attempting to swim in that
water makes my blood run cold.”</p>

<p>“Then I beg you not to think of it,” he said laughingly.
“Turn your attention to the sky instead. Did
you ever see such a black night? I haven’t, since
I’ve been in Baracoa. It certainly looks as if we’ve got
our luck with us. I haven’t much doubt, now, that
I’ll be able to get up to the fortress unobserved.”</p>

<p>All the while he was talking, he was rowing, his
strong arms pulling at the oars so vigorously that the
motor boat moved through the water almost as easily
as if it had been built to be propelled in that manner.
But presently he stopped rowing, and shipped his oars.
“Guess we can start the motor, now,” he remarked;
“we’re far enough from the shore to escape attention.
See those lights twinkling over yonder? That’s the
<em>Kearsarge</em>. And those two little lights to the east
of her are on El Torro. Notice how near to the fortress
she is anchored. You see, I shan’t have much
of a swim, after all.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled at him reproachfully. “Do you
think I am as easily deceived as all that? Those lights
may not look far apart, from here, but I happen to
know that the distance between the battleship and the
fortress is nearly half a mile. However, Mr. Hawley,
I’m not going to try to persuade you to give up this
mad undertaking, because I realize that I stand no
chance of making you listen to reason.” She sighed.<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
“It does seem unfair, though, that you should be
running all the risk, while I——”</p>

<p>“All the risk!” Hawley interrupted protestingly.
“Well, I like that! I suppose you’re not running any
risk at all? Why, you plucky girl!” he exclaimed,
deep admiration in his tone. “As a matter of fact,
you’re doing the lion’s share of the work. If our
efforts to-night result in setting President Felix free,
he’ll have you to thank for it more than anybody.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” the girl protested, much pleased, nevertheless,
by his praise. “You know very well that I
shan’t be in the slightest danger. Portiforo can’t do
anything to me, even when he finds out the trick I’ve
played his soldiers. If you thought that he could,
you would never have taken me as your assistant.
Don’t you suppose that I realize that?”</p>

<p>“But it’s going to get you into trouble with your
father,” Hawley reminded her dryly. “I don’t imagine
that Minister Throgmorton is going to be exactly
pleased when he hears of his daughter’s escapade—especially
when he finds out that her fellow conspirator
is a <cite>Sentinel</cite> man.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I suppose my father will be angry,” Virginia
agreed demurely. “However, that can’t be helped. I
never have been able to understand his great friendship
for Portiforo,” she went on, frowning. “It is
a mystery to me why he is so persistently blind to
the grossness of that tyrant. Possibly,” she suggested
archly, “it is because Portiforo flatters him.
Father is very susceptible to flattery.”</p>

<p>“Probably that is the reason,” the Camera Chap<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
acquiesced. “Think you’ll be able to manage this boat
all right after I leave you?” he inquired anxiously.
“She runs very smoothly, and all you’ve got to do,
you know, is to keep her headed straight for the fortress
landing.</p>

<p>“That will be easy,” she assured him. “Fortunately
I’ve had some experience with motor boats.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t forgotten your instructions?
You know just what you are to do after you land?
Remember, everything depends upon your ability to
keep the attention of the sentry focused on you until
after I’ve got my picture.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Virginia confidently.
“He’ll have to be an automaton if he’s able to turn
a deaf ear to my heart-rending screams of distress.”</p>

<p>Hawley, busy with the motor, echoed her laugh.
A little later the launch, running now under its own
power, had drawn so near to the <em>Kearsarge</em> that they
could hear her bells striking the hour. The Camera
Chap abruptly changed their course. “We don’t want
to get any nearer to the warship,” he explained to
his companion. “They might take it into their heads,
you know, to throw a searchlight on us, and just at
present we’re not at all eager to bask in the limelight.”</p>

<p>Virginia gazed wistfully at the shadowy outline
of the big vessel. “If only we could get them to
help us,” she murmured. “With a hundred sturdy
bluejackets from that ship, we could take the fortress
and bring back President Felix himself, instead of
merely his photograph.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“A hundred!” exclaimed Hawley, with a laugh. “I
venture to say that half a dozen would be enough.
But I’m afraid that’s out of the question. For the
present I guess we’ll have to be content with the
picture.”</p>

<p>“If we get it,” said the girl, in a sudden fit of depression.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get it,” the Camera Chap declared
confidently.</p>

<p>The motor boat was heading, now, straight for the
fortress. Presently Hawley slackened her speed and
motioned to Virginia to take his place at the wheel.
“I guess the psychological moment has arrived,” he
announced. “We won’t risk going any nearer.” He
took off his coat and shoes, and threw them overboard.
Then he fastened around his waist a belt
to which was attached a water-tight bag, which contained
his photographic apparatus.</p>

<p>“Au revoir,” he said lightly, extending his hand to
the girl. “Sure you don’t feel scared?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit—at least, not on my own account,” she
answered, pressing his hand with a warmth which in
his opinion more than compensated him for any risk
he was about to run. “Please be careful, Mr. Hawley.
If anything should happen to you——”</p>

<p>“Nothing will,” he assured her. “Nothing ever
happens to me. I guess I was born under a lucky
star.”</p>

<p>The moon had emerged from behind a black cloud,
and he ducked hastily to the bottom of the boat, fearing<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
that he would be seen from the fortress. For
half a minute he remained there; then, as another
fleeting cloud once more plunged the sky in darkness,
he left his hiding place and poised himself on the
boat’s gunwale.</p>

<p>“Try to manage to make a wide sweep so as to give
me a chance to reach the shore about the same time
you do,” he said to Virginia.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “But I don’t like to see you
venture among those horrid——” she began. Before
she could finish the sentence, the Camera Chap had
dived, entering the water so easily that she could
scarcely hear the splash.</p>

<p>As he struck out for the shore, Virginia saw a
phosphorescent streak in the water close beside him,
and she uttered a scream of terror which was not
prompted by her realization of the part she was to
play.</p>

<p>A lone sentry at El Torro heard that scream, and,
ceasing his pacing up and down his post, gazed out
to sea with great curiosity.</p>

<p>Above the sound of the waves lapping the shore,
he could hear the chug-chug-chug of a motor boat,
first faint, then rapidly becoming more distinct. Realizing
that a craft of some sort was approaching the
fortress, he brought his rifle down from his shoulder
to a horizontal position, and stood prepared to challenge
the unseen visitor.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there came to his ears a repetition
of the weird scream he had heard, followed by a series
of screams in quick succession. The moon appeared<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
from behind a cloud, and by its light he caught sight
of a launch heading toward a point of the beach about
two hundred feet to the east of where he stood.
Simultaneously he became aware of the fact that the
sole visible occupant of the boat was a woman, and
that it was she who was responsible for the cries of
terror or distress he had heard.</p>

<p>Now, fortunately for the Camera Chap and Virginia,
and the righteous cause for which they strove,
there was not in the whole army of Baracoa a more
chivalrous man than this particular sentry. Naturally
a man cast in such a sentimental mold was not
the sort to turn a deaf ear to the call of beauty in
distress. From where he stood he could not as yet
see that the woman in the motor boat was beautiful,
but he took that for granted.</p>

<p>Clubbing his rifle, he ran along the beach to the
point where the launch was about to land. As he
came near, he saw that he would not have to draw
upon his imagination in order to class the craft’s agitated
occupant as young and very fair. With added
zest he hastened to assist her to disembark.</p>

<p>“What is it, señorita?” he demanded sympathetically.
“If you will tell me what has happened——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Virginia, stumbling out of the boat
and into his arms, according to schedule. “Oh, it
was terrible. I——” Her eyes closed, and she would
have fallen if he had not held her.</p>

<p>According to the rules and regulations, it was his
duty to summon the guard, but he was too busy just
then to give thought to rules and regulations. He<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
was struggling with the dead weight of the girl, who
had become as limp and inanimate as a rag, when
a tall, dark-faced young man, who wore the fatigue
uniform of a captain, ran out of the fortress and
approached the pair.</p>

<p>“What have we here?” he demanded sternly. Then,
as his gaze rested on the girl’s face: “Good heavens!
It’s Miss Throgmorton! What is the matter with
her, Sanchez?”</p>

<p>“I think she has fainted, captain,” the sentry replied,
allowing his fair burden to drop gently to the
sand in order that he might salute his superior officer.
He pointed to the motor boat. “She came ashore in
that, a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>The sentry nodded. “She was screaming as though
in great terror.”</p>

<p>“It is strange—very strange,” muttered Captain
Ernesto Reyes. “I wonder if——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a dull report and a vivid
flash of light which came from the beach, about four
hundred feet from where they stood.</p>

<p>The sentry and his superior officer exchanged
glances of mingled mystification and dismay. Leaving
the girl, both of them started to run frantically
toward the spot from which this startling interruption
had come. Through the gloom they saw dimly a man
step to the edge of the beach, and hurl himself into
the water.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of joy, Virginia opened her<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
eyes and rose to a sitting position. “Victory!” she
murmured. “He has done it.”</p>

<p>But a second later her exultation gave place to horror
and dismay, as she heard the bark of a revolver.
By the spurt of flame which accompanied the report,
she saw Captain Reyes standing at the water’s edge,
shooting savagely at the fugitive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">CAPTAIN CORTRELL’S ORDERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A short row of high bushes in front of the fortress
had supplied the Camera Chap with a clew as to which
was the window of President Felix’s cell. Early in
his investigation, he had learned from one of the
natives of Puerto Cabero that this foliage was of
recent planting. It had been put there two years
previously, when Portiforo had first taken over the
presidency, after the sensational disappearance of
Felix.</p>

<p>Hawley had remarked that by its stage of development
it appeared to be much more than two years
old, and his informant had told him that the bushes
had been transplanted from the Botanical Gardens
by order of the president himself. Immediately the
significance of this had suggested itself to him. He
felt sure that they were intended to serve as a screen—to
guard against the possibility of some curious
person in the bay trying to get a glimpse of the occupant
of the cell by means of powerful glasses, and
he took it for granted that this precaution indicated
that the occupant of that cell was the unhappy Felix.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he landed on the beach, he did
not have to waste any time in hunting for the captive’s
cell. There was only one barred window behind
this screen of foliage, and he hastily stepped
up to it. By raising himself on tiptoe, he was just<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
able to look into the cell, and he caught sight of a
white-haired man seated at a rough wooden table,
with his back toward the window, reading a book by
the light of a sputtering candle.</p>

<p>“Señor Felix!” he whispered eagerly. “Señor
Felix!”</p>

<p>The captive jumped up with an abruptness which
upset the table, and extinguished the candle. “Who
are you, and what do you wish?” Hawley heard him
ask hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I am a friend—from the United States,” the
Camera Chap replied, busying himself with the waterproof
bag attached to his waist. “I have come to
help you, sir.”</p>

<p>“To rescue me?” the other exclaimed, with pathetic
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Eventually, yes; but all I can do now is to take
your photograph,” the Camera Chap explained. As
he spoke, he tugged at one of the iron bars, with the
hope that he might be able to wrench it from its
fastening, in which case he would, indeed, have essayed
a rescue; but, as he had feared, the iron was fastened
too securely to the stone to render that possible.</p>

<p>“My photograph!” the occupant of the cell repeated,
with a bitter laugh. “What mockery is this?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t mockery. There are plans afoot to bring
about your release, if the picture can be obtained,”
Hawley explained hurriedly. “I assure you, on my
word of honor, that it means your liberty. Drag the
table to the window and stand upon it so that your<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
face is against the bars. Quick! There is no time
to lose. I beg of you, President Felix, do as I say.
You’ve got to trust me.”</p>

<p>With prompt decision the captive complied with this
request, and a few seconds later the snapshot was an
accomplished fact. Then, for the first time, the Camera
Chap found opportunity to glance toward the
other end of the beach, where his fair ally was engaging
the attention of the sentry. He espied two
men rushing toward him, and, swiftly thrusting his
camera into its receptacle, he turned and plunged into
the sea.</p>

<p>Thus far the carrying out of his daring plan had
been effected with an ease and simplicity which exceeded
his most sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>As he had stated to Virginia, he had borrowed his
idea from the underworld. That is to say, as he had
cruised in Puerto Cabero Bay, cudgeling his brains
in an effort to find a way of luring the sentry of El
Torro from his post, there had come to his mind
an effective trick which New York crooks often work
when contemplating a robbery on a green policeman’s
beat.</p>

<p>He had never seen this trick done, but he had often
heard it described by his friends on the force. They
had told him that the wily rogues, in order to make
sure of being able to commit their crime without
danger of police interference, get some of the pals to
start a street fight at the other end of the beat. Attracted
by the noise of the brawl, the policeman rushes
to the spot, and places the rowdies under arrest. And<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
while he is marching his prisoners to the police station
to answer to a charge of disorderly conduct, the
burglars have a clear field.</p>

<p>The snapshot adventurer had reasoned that a ruse
which was clever enough to fool a New York policeman
ought to work equally as well on an El Torro
sentry. For his study of the garrison of the fortress
had convinced him that its members were not an overintelligent
lot, and, as for discipline, it was a matter
of common knowledge that the army of Baracoa was
one of the worst-disciplined military bodies in the
world.</p>

<p>The only thing which had bothered him had been
the fact that, in order to get his picture, he would
have to set off a flash light, which, of course, was
bound to attract the attention of the sentry from
Virginia to himself, and, probably, bring the whole
garrison rushing out of the fortress. He hoped, however,
that as soon as the flash light went off, and
the picture was taken, it wouldn’t make much difference
how much attention he attracted, because he
would be able to make his escape before any of them
could get near enough to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>Now, as he saw Captain Reyes and the sentry rushing
toward him, and threw himself into the sea before
they were anywhere near him, it looked as if
that hope was going to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Pursued by the bullets of Captain Reyes, he dived
to dodge the deadly hail, and swam under water while
his breath lasted. Presently he rose to the surface,
and struck out, with the long, vigorous stroke of an<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
expert swimmer, for the battleship, whose lighted hull
seemed just then to be miles away.</p>

<p>He encountered no obstacles in his course, and before
he had any feeling of exhaustion, so finely trained
was he for the task, his hand grasped the starboard
accommodation ladder of the warship, and he lifted
himself clear of the water.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, white-faced, and somewhat
shaky in the legs, hatless and coatless, and dripping
water from head to foot, he stood in the presence
of the battleship’s commander, who, recognizing him
despite his disheveled appearance, stared at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You told me to come back to you, captain, as soon
as I got the snapshot,” the Camera Chap began.</p>

<p>Captain Cortrell’s face lighted up. “Have you
brought it?” he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>“I have brought the plate. I haven’t had a chance
to develop it yet, so I don’t know how it turned out,
but I generally have pretty good luck with flash lights.
Don’t happen to have a photographic dark room
aboard, do you, captain?”</p>

<p>The naval officer shook his head. “I guess we could
fix you up a dark room easily enough, but we haven’t
the materials for developing a negative, if that’s what
you mean. I’m sorry that we haven’t,” he added,
“for I don’t mind confessing, Mr. Hawley, that I am
impatient to see your picture.”</p>

<p>“I will go ashore at once, develop the plate, and
bring you back a print,” the Camera Chap promised.
“I have a complete outfit in my room at the hotel.<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
But in the meantime, captain,” he added anxiously,
“if you have any instructions which concern me—as I
feel confident you have——”</p>

<p>Captain Cortrell cut him short with a curt gesture.
“Go ahead and get your plate developed,” he said
gruffly. “Whatever instructions I may have concerning
you, sir, cannot be discussed until you have brought
me the snapshot—a finished picture, not an invisible
negative.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t safe to wait until then. I am afraid
you may be too late,” the Camera Chap protested.</p>

<p>“Too late for what, sir?”</p>

<p>“To save President Felix. If you don’t act
promptly, I am afraid they will assassinate him.
Every minute counts now.”</p>

<p>A slightly bewildered expression came to the naval
officer’s face. His demeanor aroused Hawley’s indignation.
The latter suspected that his air of mystification
was feigned, that his attitude must be due
to an excess of caution.</p>

<p>“See here, Captain Cortrell!” he exclaimed impatiently;
“there’s no sense in our playing at cross-purposes
with each other. There isn’t time for anything
of that sort. I am quite sure that you know who sent
me to Baracoa, and what I am doing here——”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it,” the other interrupted,
but Hawley impatiently waved aside the disclaimer.</p>

<p>“And therefore I have no hesitancy in talking
plainly to you,” he continued. “I don’t know just what
your orders are, but if they provide for any protection
being extended to Felix—as I trust is the case—I assure<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
you that no time is to be lost. If you land a force
of men at the fortress at once you may be able to
save him, but if you delay, I fear it will be fatal.”</p>

<p>During this speech the bewildered expression passed
from Captain Cortrell’s face, and was replaced by
one of great astonishment. “Am I to understand
that the man whose photograph you were to bring
me is Francisco Felix, the missing President of Baracoa?”
he inquired excitedly.</p>

<p>“Why, of course. Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“And he is in El Torro fortress?”</p>

<p>“He was there—half an hour ago,” the Camera
Chap replied significantly. “It may be too late, even
now, to save him, but if not, you must realize that
we can’t afford to beat about the bush. No doubt
a report of my visit to the fortress, to-night, and the
taking of the flash light, has already been sent to
Portiforo. If so, he will probably resort at once to
desperate measures.”</p>

<p>The naval officer’s face grew grim. “What do you
expect me to do?” he inquired coolly.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap showed his astonishment at the
question. “It seems to me that there is only one
thing to do, captain—rescue Felix before Portiforo’s
assassins can get to him. Why,” he went on eagerly,
“the thing could be done in ten minutes without any
trouble at all. I don’t know much about military
tactics, but I’ve been studying the garrison of El Torro
pretty closely for the past few days, and my observations
make me feel confident that one boatload of
your marines would be sufficient to take possession<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
of the fortress without even a gun being fired. Or if
you don’t care to go quite as far as that,” he added,
“there is no need for your men to enter the fortress
at all. They could rescue Felix from the outside—the
same way that I got my picture. All that they’d
have to do would be to step up to his window, break
down the bars, and lift him through the opening.”</p>

<p>The warship’s commander smiled grimly. “Yes; I
reckon it could be done,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you will do it?”</p>

<p>The old sea dog hesitated. The Camera Chap saw
a grim expression come to his weather-beaten face.
It quickly passed away, however. “I am sorry, my
boy,” he said, real regret in his tone, “but, as I said
before, I can do nothing until you have brought me
the snapshot. You see,” he explained, “I am here
under sealed orders—I don’t mind telling you that
much in return for the information you have given
me. In view of what I have learned from you, I
now have what some of my junior officers would no
doubt term ‘a good-sized hunch,’ as to the nature of
those orders. I think it very likely that when the
envelope is opened, it will be found to contain official
instructions for me to proceed immediately to take the
very action you urge.”</p>

<p>“Then why not open it immediately?” the Camera
Chap suggested impatiently.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but that is out of the question. The
conditions must first be complied with. I appreciate
the danger of delay, my boy, but orders are orders.
I would suggest that the best thing for you to do is<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
to hurry ashore, get that picture finished, and bring
it to me as quickly as possible. Then, provided my
orders permit it, I will promise you prompt action.”</p>

<p>Perceiving that argument would be useless, the
Camera Chap proceeded to follow this advice. The
commander of the <em>Kearsarge</em> placed a speedy steam
launch at his disposal, and also suggested that it would
be a good idea for him to have a naval escort when
he went ashore. “We don’t want to have any mishaps,”
the captain remarked dryly, “and it is just
possible that circumstances might arise in which you
would find it mighty convenient to be surrounded by
an armed guard.”</p>

<p>Hawley immediately grasped his point, for the possibility
of an attempt being made ashore to wrest the
precious picture from him had already suggested itself
to his mind. “Thank you, captain; I shall be glad to
take advantage of your kind offer,” he said. “I think,
however, that one of your men will be enough, if you
can spare Lieutenant Ridder for a little while. He
and I are old friends, and if he were along with me,
I should feel perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>This request met with a ready response, and a few
minutes later Hawley and the husky young lieutenant
were speeding toward the shore of Puerto Cabero.</p>

<p>As they landed from the launch, the Camera Chap
caught sight of two men skulking in the shadow of
the wharf, and when he and Ridder walked toward
the railway station, he observed that these men stealthily
followed them. By the light of a street lamp he
was able to get a good look at their faces, and he<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
recognized one of them instantly. It was his old acquaintance,
Señor Lopez, the mysterious individual
who had been his fellow passenger on board the steamship
<em>Colombia</em>, and who had displayed such a keen
interest in his movements. The Camera Chap had not
seen the fellow since the day of their arrival at Puerto
Cabero. He was not at all glad to see him, now.
He had an uneasy suspicion that Lopez’s presence at
the wharf was no mere coincidence—that already the
tidings of what had happened at the fortress had been
flashed to the capital, and that the spy had been sent
to await his landing.</p>

<p>Fearing for the safety of his precious snapshot, he
was doubly glad, now, that he had brought Ridder
along with him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE PLATE DEVELOPED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A train was just about to pull out of the station,
when Hawley and his companion arrived there. It
was the last train to leave for the capital that night,
and the Camera Chap congratulated himself upon his
luck in catching it. If he had been half a minute
later he might have found himself stranded in the
seaport for the night, for at that hour it was difficult
to find any kind of conveyance for hire, even a horse;
in which case he would have been obliged to wait until
morning before developing his plate.</p>

<p>As they jumped on the train, he glanced behind
him, and saw that Lopez and his companion were evidently
determined not to lose him, for they, too, got
aboard, taking the precaution, however, of entering a
car at the other end of the train.</p>

<p>If there had been time to take such a step, Hawley
would have gone to the trouble of endeavoring to
throw his shadowers off his trail before proceeding
to his hotel, but, realizing the necessity of getting the
picture finished and into the hands of the commander
of the battleship without delay, he decided that he
must run whatever risk lay in having them at his
heels.</p>

<p>While the spies were only two in number, he had
no fear of an attempt on their part to adopt violent
tactics in order to get possession of the negative; he<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
apprehended, however, that as soon as they reached
the capital they might be joined by reënforcements,
and with grim satisfaction he patted a pocket of the
coat with which Captain Cortrell had supplied him
from his own wardrobe, to replace the garment he
had lost. In that pocket reposed a loaded forty-four.
With this toy, plus the moral and physical support
of his friend, Lieutenant Ridder, he felt confident that
Portiforo was going to have quite a time getting that
plate away from him, even though he sent a whole
regiment to do the job.</p>

<p>As soon as he and the naval officer arrived at his
room on the top floor of the Hotel Nacional, he took
the precaution, after locking the door, of piling up
all the furniture of the room against it. Having thus
guarded against surprise in that direction, he stationed
Ridder on the balcony outside the one window
of the room. With the alert lieutenant crouching
there, revolver in hand, he felt confident that there
would be no invasion from that quarter.</p>

<p>As he had told Captain Cortrell, he had in his trunk
a ruby lamp, and all the other materials necessary
for developing a plate, and make a print from it by
artificial light. It was not often that he did his own
developing, but he had brought them with him, foreseeing
the possibility of just such an emergency as the
present one.</p>

<p>By the light of the ruby lamp, he opened the waterproof
bag which contained his camera, and was relieved
to find that, despite its exposure to the sea,
not a drop of moisture had touched its contents. Removing<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
the plate holder from the camera, he withdrew
the negative and plunged it into the developing
bath. With intense eagerness he leaned over the
shallow hard-rubber tray, waiting for the first dim
outline to show itself on the glass, probably more
nervous than he had ever before been in his eventful
life.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the young naval officer on guard
on the balcony heard an exclamation of dismay from
within the room.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” Ridder whispered hoarsely.
“Need any help in there?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and an anxious expression
came to his face. The shade of the window was
drawn, and Hawley had warned him that under no
circumstances must he disturb it while the work of
developing the picture was in progress, as the admission
of the slightest ray of moonlight into the room
might spoil the negative. Still, he scarcely felt like
waiting there when, evidently, something had happened
to the Camera Chap.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong in there?” he repeated, tapping impatiently
against the glass. “May I come in, Hawley?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap threw open the window. “Sure;
come on in,” he said. “There’s no reason for you
to stay out there any longer.”</p>

<p>“The picture is finished?”</p>

<p>Hawley laughed ironically. “Yes, it’s finished, all
right—completely finished. Take a look at it.” As
he spoke he held up the square of wet glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know much about this sort of thing,” said
the navy man, taking the negative gingerly, and holding
it against the light of the ruby lamp. “It’s always
been a mystery to me how you fellows can tell at a
glance whether a negative is a good or a poor one.
The few I’ve handled all looked pretty much alike
to me. They all—why, hello! There doesn’t seem
to be anything on this plate. I can’t see a blessed line.
Anything wrong with it, old man?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled ruefully. “No, there’s
nothing wrong with it at all,” he said. “It’s a perfectly
good plate—only, unfortunately, it’s never been
exposed.”</p>

<p>“Never been exposed?” Ridder repeated, too ignorant
of photographic terms to grasp immediately the
full significance of this announcement. “Do you mean
that the picture is spoiled?”</p>

<p>“I mean that the picture was never there,” the
Camera Chap replied. “Something was wrong with
the shutter of my camera. It couldn’t have been open
when I set off the flash light. Can you beat that
for tough luck?”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” the lieutenant murmured. “I guess the
old man will be disappointed when he hears this. I
don’t know what this picture business is all about,
since neither of you has seen fit to take me into the
secret, but I gathered from the skipper’s manner that
he was dead anxious to get the snapshot.” He glanced
at the Camera Chap anxiously. “Does this mishap
make much difference, old man? Can’t you take the
picture over again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>The question brought a sardonic smile to the other’s
face. “I suppose that’s what I’ll have to do—take it
over again,” he said presently, the smile giving place
to an expression of grim resolution.</p>

<p>Just then they were interrupted by a knock at the
door. The two men exchanged a questioning glance,
and the Camera Chap’s hand went to his coat pocket,
and grasped the revolver it contained. Lieutenant
Ridder’s weapon was still in his hand.</p>

<p>But suddenly, as the knock was repeated, the Camera
Chap’s face relaxed, and his hand came empty
out of his pocket. “Whoever it is, we might as well
let them come in,” he said, in an undertone to Ridder.
“There is no reason to keep them out, now.”</p>

<p>In a louder tone he demanded who was there, and
there was a whispered consultation outside before anybody
replied.</p>

<p>“It is a friend. Open the door, Señor Hawley.
I must see you immediately,” somebody answered.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap laughed. “Wait a minute,
friend,” he called, dragging the furniture from the
door.</p>

<p>As he turned the key in the lock, the door flew
open, and Señor Lopez stepped into the room. He
was by no means alone. Behind him flocked a dozen
men, who wore the uniform of the army of Baracoa.
Each of them held a revolver in his right hand.</p>

<p>“There is your man,” Lopez cried dramatically
pointing to Hawley. Whereupon one of the soldiers,
whose epaulets proclaimed him to be of higher rank<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
than the others, stepped up to the Camera Chap and
pressed the barrel of his weapon against his breast.</p>

<p>“I regret to have to inform you, señor, that you
must accompany us at once,” he said politely. “You
are under arrest.”</p>

<p>Hawley laughed lightly. “This is so sudden,” he
said. “Might I inquire, gentlemen, the nature of the
charge against me?”</p>

<p>“I think that Señor Hawley can guess the nature
of the charge against him,” Lopez sneered. “If not,
however, he will be fully informed later. Come, captain,
hadn’t you better search the prisoner?”</p>

<p>Up to this point Lieutenant Ridder had stood as
though spellbound. Now, gun in hand, he stepped
forward, contemptuously careless of the fact that
eleven revolvers were pointed his way.</p>

<p>“This man is an American citizen,” he exclaimed,
ranging himself alongside the Camera Chap. “You’re
not going to take him away, and you’re not going to
search him, either. If you fellows are looking for
trouble——”</p>

<p>With a laugh the Camera Chap cut him short. “It’s
no use, Ridder, old man,” he said. “I guess you’ve
got to let them take me. Put up that gun. As an
officer of the United States navy you can’t afford to
mix up with this little unpleasantness.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A SERIOUS SITUATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Virginia Throgmorton’s return from the fortress
to the United States legation was almost as comfortable
a proceeding as if she had been coming home
from a social function. Captain Ernesto Reyes himself
escorted her in the launch to Puerto Cabero.
The last train to the capital had gone when they
reached the station, but the gallant captain knew
where a fast automobile could be obtained, and, pressing
it into service, rode with her to the door of her
home.</p>

<p>Captain Reyes’ manner toward her was very sympathetic.
If he had any suspicions of the part she
had played in the Camera Chap’s adventure, he did
not betray them. Apparently he was completely deceived
by the ingenuous story which she had narrated
in order to account for her startling visit to the
fortress.</p>

<p>This story, which was the Camera Chap’s invention,
was true enough—as far as it went. She explained
that she had been out motor boating in the bay with
a young man, a friend from the United States. The
motor-boat trip had started out most delightfully, but
just as the boat arrived in the vicinity of the fortress,
her companion had spoiled the whole evening for her
by suddenly falling or jumping overboard. What
had become of him she did not know. She feared<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
that he might have been killed by the harbor sharks.
What had happened after that, Captain Reyes knew
as well as she did; screaming with terror, she had
headed the boat toward the fortress, and had fallen
fainting into the arms of the sentry.</p>

<p>When Captain Reyes and, later, the commandant
of the garrison, had asked her to tell the name of
her man companion who had been unfortunate enough
to fall overboard, she declared, with a blush, that she
would rather not give that information, as the man
was not in the good graces of her father, and she
feared that she would get into trouble at home if
the fact that she had been with him should come out.</p>

<p>Greatly to her astonishment, they had appeared to
be satisfied with this ingenuous explanation which
she and Hawley had expected would prove to be the
weakest part of her story. The Camera Chap had
instructed her that if this evasion should prove ineffectual,
and the inquisitors should insist upon her
telling the name of her escort, she was finally to give
them the information, since her refusal to do so might
get her into trouble. Virginia had secretly resolved
to disregard her ally’s instructions in this respect.
She had made up her mind that she would languish
in a Baracoan dungeon for the rest of her days before
she would mention the Camera Chap’s name.
But, fortunately, it did not come to that. The commandant
said courteously that he would respect Miss
Throgmorton’s wishes in the matter, and not force
her to make any revelations which were embarrassing
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>Later on, Virginia learned the explanation of this
astonishing forbearance, but it did not occur to her,
then, that the reason they did not press her for the
name of her companion might be that the name was
known to them already.</p>

<p>Expressing deep sympathy for her alarming experience,
the gallant commandant of El Torro had
offered her refreshments, and then assigned Captain
Reyes to escort her home.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Virginia sent a trusted
messenger to the Hotel Nacional, with a note for
Hawley. The messenger was instructed to bring back
the note to her if the Camera Chap was not there.
The girl realized the imprudence of this act, but she
felt that she must know without delay what had become
of the daring man of whose fate she was in
absolute ignorance. Half an hour later her messenger,
an old negro manservant, whom her father had brought
with him from the United States, and who had been
in the service of the Throgmortons since Virginia’s
birth, returned to the embassy and handed back her
note.</p>

<p>“He is not there?” she exclaimed. “Hasn’t he been
back to the hotel since last night?”</p>

<p>The old servant nodded. “Yes; he has been back,
Miss Virginia; but he is not there, now,” he whispered.
“He has been arrested. The clerk informed
me that soldiers came to Mr. Hawley’s room late last
night and took him away to the arsenal.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s first sensation upon hearing this was one
of intense relief. The situation was bad enough, to<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
be sure, but the thought of the Camera Chap being
in a prison cell was not nearly so disquieting as the
fear that he might have been drowned or killed.</p>

<p>“Arrested!” she cried. “On what charge, Uncle
Peter?”</p>

<p>The old negro shook his head. “I couldn’t find
out what they done accuse him of, Miss Virginia,”
he replied. “The clerk didn’t know.”</p>

<p>She did not have to wait long, however, to be informed
on this point, for just then Gale entered the
room. He appeared to be greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Heard the news, Virginia?” he asked. “A friend
of yours was arrested last night.”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine?” the girl echoed, with an inflection
of wonder. “Who was that?”</p>

<p>The reporter grinned. “A young man named Frank
Hawley, sometimes known as the Camera Chap,” he
announced. “From what I hear, he’s in pretty bad.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Virginia exclaimed, arching her eyebrows.
“What has he done?”</p>

<p>Gale’s grin broadened. “They accuse him of being
a spy,” he declared.</p>

<p>“A spy!” cried the girl, with a nervous laugh.
“Why, how perfectly absurd. Surely he will have no
difficulty in disproving that charge.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” the reporter rejoined, a vestige of a
sneer in his tone. “Well, I’m not so sure of that.
It looks to me as if they’ve got the goods on him.
He went out to the fortress last night and took a
flash-light photograph of the fortifications. That’s a
pretty serious business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></p>

<p>“Flash light of the fortifications!” Virginia cried
impulsively. “Is that what they think he was after?”</p>

<p>She regretted the words as soon as they were out
of her mouth, and would have given a great deal to
be able to recall them, as she observed the astonished
expression which came to the man’s face.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” he demanded sharply.
“Have you any reason to think that he was after
anything else?”</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. “How should I
know what he was after?” she said indignantly.
“What I meant was, that I scarcely thought it possible
that he would have gone there for that reason. Mr.
Hawley isn’t a spy; he is a newspaper man. It is
much more logical to suppose that if he took any
picture at all, it was a photograph of the fortress
for publication in his paper.” A shade flitted across
her face. “What does he say?” she demanded, striving
desperately to keep all trace of anxiety out of
her voice. “What explanation does he give?”</p>

<p>“That’s the queer part of it,” the reporter replied.
“He won’t give any explanation at all. They tell
me that he’s as tight-mouthed as a Wall Street magnate
before a congressional investigation committee.
To all questions they put to him last night he replied
that he refused to answer, by advice of counsel. The
idiot seems to take his arrest as a joke.”</p>

<p>An expression of admiration came to Virginia’s
pretty face. She felt sure that she understood the
reason for the Camera Chap’s uncommunicative attitude.
It was not with an idea of making things easier<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
for himself, she knew, that he had refused to answer
their questions. It was because he was determined
to make no statement which might lead Portiforo to
suspect the truth, with disastrous results for the unfortunate
captive of El Torro.</p>

<p>“But, take it from me, he’ll soon find that it’s no
joke,” Gale went on, a malicious glint in his eyes.
“He’ll be lucky if he gets off with a prison sentence.
The chances are that they’ll back him up against a
stone wall, with a handkerchief over his eyes and a
firing squad in front of him. That’s the treatment
they generally hand out to spies.”</p>

<p>Virginia turned pale. “They wouldn’t dare do
that!” she gasped. “Even Portiforo would be afraid
to go so far with a citizen of the United States.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Gale rejoined. “It’s
been done before, you know. When a man’s convicted
of being a spy, they can do as they please with
him, and his government is powerless to interfere.
That’s international law. Surely you, the daughter
of a diplomat, ought to know that.”</p>

<p>Virginia did know that, and an expression of horror
came to her eyes. Then, suddenly, her face lighted
up. “You are exaggerating the situation, Mr. Gale,”
she said, with a scornful laugh. “They don’t shoot
spies in times of peace. If you are such an authority
on international law, you ought to know that. It is
only when there is war that they adopt such stern
measures.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” the reporter returned, with a grin.
“But evidently, my dear Virginia, you are not aware<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
that the Republic of Baracoa happens to be in a state
of war at the present moment. I heard, this morning,
that Rodriguez, who broke out of jail the other
day, reached the hills yesterday, and raised the standard
of revolt. And they accuse Hawley of being
mixed up with the revolutionary party. So you see, I
am not exaggerating the seriousness of his plight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The soft-footed man with the wolflike smile, known
as Señor Lopez, was elated over the arrest of that
adventurous man, the Camera Chap, and warmly congratulated
himself upon the stroke of luck which had
enabled him to bring it about so speedily, for it had
been a mere coincidence that he happened to be standing
near the dock, earlier that evening, when Hawley,
accompanied by a young woman whom the spy immediately
recognized as the daughter of the American
minister, approached the water’s edge and furtively
embarked in a motor boat.</p>

<p>His curiosity aroused, Lopez would have followed
the pair, but was prevented from doing so by his
failure to obtain a craft in time; so he had to content
himself for the time being with speculating as to the
motive of this evidently secret expedition. At first
he had supposed that they were bound for the American
warship, but later the possibility that the fortress
might be their goal had suggested itself to his mind.
As soon as this suspicion occurred to him he sent
a note to the commandant of the fortress warning
him to keep a sharp lookout for the pair; but by the
time his messenger reached the fortress Hawley had
already been there, taken his snapshot, and escaped
by throwing himself into the sea.</p>

<p>Lopez’s note had arrived just as the commandant<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
and Captain Reyes were questioning Virginia as to
the identity of her mysterious companion, and it was
for this reason that they had astonished the girl by
their apparent courtesy in not pressing her to give
them the information they desired.</p>

<p>When Lopez’s messenger returned to him with a
brief reply from the commandant stating what had
occurred at the fortress, the spy decided to wait at
the dock in the hope that later on the snapshot adventurer
would return in one of the battleship’s
launches; for he was shrewd enough to suspect that
Hawley’s motive in throwing himself into the sea was
to swim out to the <em>Kearsarge</em>.</p>

<p>Possessed of the patience of a cat, he would have
waited there all night if necessary, but such a display
of endurance was not required of him, for shortly
afterward a gray launch dashed up to the pier and
two young men came ashore. Recognizing one of
them as the man he was waiting for, the spy trailed
the pair to San Cristobal, and thence to the Hotel
Nacional. Then he hurried to the nearest barracks,
provided himself with a military escort, and returned
to make the arrest.</p>

<p>After the soldiers had taken Hawley away Lopez
spent some time in making a thorough search of the
latter’s room at the Hotel Nacional. Then he went
to the arsenal to have a talk with the prisoner.</p>

<p>The cell in which the Camera Chap was confined
did not exactly measure up to the standard of luxury
of a first-class hotel. The floor was of cement, hard
and cold, and had every appearance of not having<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
been cleaned since the place was built. There was no
furniture, save a rusty iron cot which was attached
to the wall. This couch, which was supposed to serve
both as bed and chair, was without pillow or mattress.
If the prisoner wished to sleep he would have to get
used to stretching himself on the unyielding iron slats.
But these physical discomforts did not appear to have
a depressing effect upon the present occupant of the
dungeon, judging by the cheerful smile with which
he greeted Lopez when the latter stepped softly up
to the bars.</p>

<p>“I suppose here’s where I get a chance to study at
first-hand the Baracoan method of administering the
third degree,” he remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>The visitor shrugged his shoulders. “I desire merely
to ask Señor Hawley a few questions,” he announced.
“I hope for his sake that he will find it convenient
to answer them.”</p>

<p>“Well, you might submit a sample question,” the
prisoner replied. “I’ll be able to tell you better, then,
what chance you stand of having your curiosity satisfied.”</p>

<p>Lopez bowed. “To begin with, what have you done
with the picture you took to-night?”</p>

<p>“Why, it seems to me that you can answer that
question yourself. I saw you take the plate from
the table and put it in your pocket before your army
took me out of the room.”</p>

<p>His visitor looked at him searchingly. “You refer
to the plate that was spoiled, señor? Was that the
only snapshot you took?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“It was, on my word of honor,” Hawley answered
with intense earnestness. He had no wish to evade
this question; on the contrary he was most anxious
to have his interrogator know that there was no other
picture.</p>

<p>“And this spoiled plate—what does it represent?
If Señor Hawley had been successful with his camera
what would the plate have shown?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled. “It seems to me that
you’re asking a hypothetical question,” he said. “Yes,
decidely hypothetical.”</p>

<p>Lopez shrugged his expressive shoulders again. “It
is Señor Hawley’s privilege to answer or not as he
sees fit, but,” he added, “I must warn him that if
he refuses to tell why he went to the fortress to-night
we shall be compelled to draw our own conclusions
from his silence.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” Hawley rejoined cheerfully.
“Have you any objections to dropping me a hint as
to what those conclusions may be?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. Unless the señor is prepared
to give us an explanation more favorable to himself
we shall assume that he went there to get photographs
of the fortifications—that he is a spy in the service
of the insurrectos.”</p>

<p>“An insurrecto spy! Well, of all the——” the
president’s photographic envoy began. Then he abruptly
cut himself short as the advantages of having
this interpretation placed upon his act suddenly occurred
to him—advantages to others, although possibly
not to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“And no doubt Señor Hawley is aware of what
happens to those who are convicted on that serious
charge,” his visitor suggested quietly.</p>

<p>The prisoner imitated the other’s shrug. “Oh, well,
I guess I’ll be able to stand it,” he said optimistically.
“I can’t truthfully say that the accommodations of
this hostelry are pleasant, but no doubt I shan’t find
them so bad after I get used to them.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid the señor is laboring under a slight
misapprehension,” he remarked. “In the event of his
conviction he would have no chance to get used to
these accommodations. He would be tried under
martial law, and—under martial law a spy’s punishment
is not imprisonment.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap looked uncomfortable as he
caught the significance of this remark, but almost immediately
he regained his composure. “Well, you’ve
got to convict me first,” he remarked confidently. “You
can’t hang a man on suspicion alone—at least, you
can’t do it if that man happens to be a citizen of the
U. S. A. If you dare to convict me without sufficient
proof I venture to predict that something is going
to happen to Baracoa.”</p>

<p>The assurance with which he said this was not
wholly feigned. While he realized that in the event
of his guilt being proven his government would be
powerless to protect him, he felt sure that Washington
would demand the strongest kind of proof before
they would permit the sentence to be carried out.
And he had a shrewd suspicion that the enemy had
only a circumstantial case against him. He felt positive<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
that in the gloom it had been impossible for
Captain Reyes or the sentry to recognize him, so that
unless Virginia Throgmorton had been compelled to
reveal his identity there was no direct evidence that
it was actually he who was the mysterious photographer
who had visited El Torro.</p>

<p>“Señor Hawley can rest assured that we shall be
able to produce sufficient proof of his guilt,” Lopez
boasted. “To begin with, we can show that he stands
high in the confidence of the insurrectos.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” the prisoner exclaimed, carefully weighing
this statement. “Might I inquire how you expect
to prove that?”</p>

<p>“By the fact that he was in conference with one
of their most active leaders, the other day. I refer
to the infamous Doctor Gaspard Bonsal. I presume,
señor, that you will not attempt to deny that you
visited him when I tell you that you were seen surreptitiously
leaving his house on the night of his
arrest.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself the Camera Chap was unable
to avoid a start of astonishment, for until that moment
the fact that his visit to the venerable physician
was known to the enemy had not entered his mind.</p>

<p>“If I was seen, how is it that I, too, was not
arrested?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Once more there was a display of gestures and
shrugs. “I believe there is a saying in the señor’s
own beautiful language to the effect that it is sometimes
advisable to give a rogue plenty of rope in order
that he may bring about his own hanging.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>“Who claims to have seen me?”</p>

<p>“I myself had that honor,” Lopez answered, with
a bow.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed the prisoner, with an ironical
laugh, “you certainly are the busy little man. Nothing
seems to escape those eagle eyes of yours. But,
after all, the fact that you saw me leaving a physician’s
house doesn’t strike me as being very incriminating.
How do you know I didn’t go there to consult
him professionally?”</p>

<p>“If Señor Hawley can prove that such was the case
it would undoubtedly be to his advantage,” Lopez
responded. “But, of course, in that event, his testimony
would have to agree with that of the lady.”</p>

<p>“The lady?” A shade of anxiety flitted across the
snapshot adventurer’s face.</p>

<p>“I refer to the lady who came out of Doctor Bonsal’s
house that night with Señor Hawley and entered the
automobile which was waiting for her at the garden
gate. Señora Felix was heavily veiled, but that disguise
was not sufficient to prevent me from recognizing
her.”</p>

<p>Portiforo’s spy laughed maliciously at the prisoner’s
evident discomfiture. “And she is not the only
fair witness we shall have at the trial in the event
of Señor Hawley’s insisting that he is not an insurrecto
spy,” he announced. “The government of Baracoa
would regret exceedingly having to put the daughter
of the United States minister to any inconvenience,
but if Señor Hawley’s attitude makes the testimony
of these ladies necessary——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>“Their testimony won’t be necessary,” Hawley interrupted
grimly. “Whatever happens, we’ll leave the
women entirely out of this business.”</p>

<p>Lopez bowed. “Señor Hawley has decided most
chivalrously.” With this remark, evidently well satisfied
with the result of their conversation, he turned
on his heels and abruptly left the prisoner to his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>Those thoughts were not pleasant ones. For some
time the president’s photographic envoy sat on the
edge of his iron cot, his hands supporting his chin,
reflecting moodily on the situation. He realized that
he was confronted by the most serious predicament
of his career. If he revealed the real motive of his
expedition to the fortress, it would, of course, clear
him of the charge of being a revolutionary spy. They
couldn’t do much to an American newspaper photographer
for attempting to take a snapshot of a political
prisoner. They would be compelled to let him off
with a slight punishment. But he had not the slightest
intention of making such a revelation. From the demeanor
of Lopez he had an uneasy suspicion that
the truth was already known to that perspicacious
person, and that this threat of condemning him as a
spy had been made with the idea of forcing him to
show his hand. Still, there was a chance that he
might be mistaken, that in spite of all that had happened
Portiforo and his fellow conspirators might
still be under the impression that their secret was safe,
and while there was that chance Hawley did not feel
at liberty to betray the confidence of the President<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
of the United States and imperil the life of Felix
in order to save his own neck.</p>

<p>He realized that Lopez had not exaggerated the
peril which he faced, for he knew that under martial
law, capital punishment is the fate of a spy; and as
Rodriguez, since his escape from prison, had fled to
the hills and started an incipient revolution, he believed
that it was under martial law that he would
be tried. That his government would see that he had
a fair trial he felt confident, but as his lips were sealed
by this threat to call Virginia and Señora Felix as
witnesses if he sought to make his accusers prove their
charge, he already looked upon himself as doomed.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m up against it,” he mused grimly. “It
looks as if friend Portiforo holds all the trump cards.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A VAIN APPEAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Greatly alarmed by what Gale had told her concerning
the Camera Chap’s peril, Virginia lost no time
in seeking an interview with her father. She found
the latter seated in his library engaged in the preparation
of a long dispatch to Washington. He looked
up from his cipher code with a frown as she entered.</p>

<p>“Some other time, my dear; I am exceedingly busy
just now,” he protested. “This dispatch has got to
be sent off at once.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t wait,” the girl announced. “The business
I want to talk over with you is more important
than what you are doing. Unless,” she added, with
a flash of intuition, “that telegram you are writing
concerns the arrest of Mr. Hawley.”</p>

<p>The United States minister swung around in his
swivel chair and regarded his daughter with surprise.
“How on earth did you guess that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Then it is about Mr. Hawley!” the girl exclaimed
joyously. “You are cabling the state department that
you are going to get him out of prison immediately?”</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton shook his head. “On the
contrary, my dear, I am informing Washington that
we can do nothing for him, except to make sure that
he gets a fair trial,” he said coldly. “The young
man has only himself to blame for his predicament.
If he is guilty of the serious offense with which he<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
is charged—and I am given to understand that the
government of Baracoa has the strongest kind of a
case against him—he must suffer the consequences.
The United States government cannot afford to affront
a friendly nation by acting in behalf of a mercenary
adventurer who has been caught red-handed as a spy
for the revolutionists.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Hawley isn’t a mercenary adventurer,”
Virginia protested. “Nor is he a revolutionary spy.
I happen to know that he——” She stopped short,
suddenly realizing the danger of completing what she
had started out to say. In her zeal to save her plucky
friend, she had been about to take her father into
her confidence concerning the worthy mission which
had brought the snapshot wizard to Baracoa, but just
in time she recalled that she had made a promise to
Hawley that, no matter what happened, she would not
give away his secret.</p>

<p>Observing her hesitancy, Throgmorton looked at
her keenly. “You happen to know that he is—what?”
he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“I happen to know that he is a newspaper man,”
the girl replied evasively.</p>

<p>“A <cite>Sentinel</cite> man, you mean,” the diplomat rejoined
tartly. “That certainly is nothing in his favor. My
own experience with that sensational sheet has been
quite sufficient to convince me that everybody connected
with it is capable of almost anything.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s blue eyes flashed indignantly. “And that
is why you are taking this attitude toward Mr. Hawley,”
she said bitterly. “Just because the paper he<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
represents has been unkind to you in its editorial
columns you have made up your mind not to interfere
in his behalf. It is incredible to me, father, that
you could be as small as that.”</p>

<p>The diplomat frowned. “I think you forget yourself,
my dear Virginia,” he said with dignity. “Your
insinuation is not only disrespectful, it is preposterous.
I hope that I am conscientious enough not to allow
my personal prejudices to influence me in the discharge
of my duty. By the way,” he added sharply,
“might I inquire why you appear to be so greatly
interested in the fate of this spy? Surely it cannot
be possible that you number him among your friends?”</p>

<p>“I do,” the girl answered warmly. “He is the
bravest, most unselfish man I have ever met, and I
am proud to be able to say that he is my friend.
And what’s more,” she added, a light of determination
in her blue eyes, “whether you will do anything
for him or not, he’s not going to be made the victim
of Portiforo’s vengeance if I can help it.”</p>

<p>Her father’s frown deepened. “My dear child, you
are talking most intemperately. The object of your
misplaced sympathy is not going to be made the victim
of anybody’s vengeance. You can rest assured,
as I said before, that he will have a fair and impartial
trial. As the representative of his country I shall see
to that. And that is all that he or any other fair-minded
person could expect me to do for him.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t all,” the girl protested. “There needn’t
be any trial at all if you don’t wish it. You have
sufficient personal influence with the Portiforo administration<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
to have him set free even though he
were guilty.”</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton shrugged his shoulders. “I
fear that you overestimate my power, my dear,” he
said deprecatingly. “However, even if I had sufficient
influence, I don’t think I should feel justified
in using it in that way. The prisoner’s demeanor is
scarcely such as to entitle him to clemency. His bearing
toward the authorities is almost defiant; and, as
for his attitude toward me——”</p>

<p>Virginia interrupted him with an excited exclamation.
“You have been to see him?” she inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I called at the arsenal immediately after his
arrest. I deemed it my duty to interview him.” He
paused, and an expression of annoyance came to his
face. “But I could get absolutely nothing out of him.
The fellow was almost contemptuous in his refusal
to answer my questions. No; I certainly shouldn’t
feel like doing any more than my duty calls for to
help him.”</p>

<p>After some further pleading and argument, Virginia
went out of the room convinced that so far as
her father was concerned the Camera Chap was a
doomed man. For a while she was in despair; then an
idea came to her which caused her to order the touring
car and journey therein to Puerto Cabero.
Arrived at the seaport, she went down to the wharf
which the <em>Kearsarge’s</em> launches were using for a landing.
One of the battleship’s graceful little fifty-footers
had just come in with a liberty party of<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
jackies. Virginia addressed a natty young officer in
charge of the men. “Is this boat going right back
to the battleship?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes, miss. Do you wish to go?”</p>

<p>“If Captain Cortrell is there. I must see him
immediately.”</p>

<p>The officer replied that she would find the commanding
officer in his cabin, and a few minutes later
Virginia was speeding over the water toward the big
gray fighter. As she reached the warship’s side and
stepped to the main deck her hopes suddenly soared.
The sight of the guns protruding from the grim turrets,
and the sturdy, white-jacketed boys from her
own land swarming over the decks, was decidedly reassuring.
Somehow, in spite of what her father had
said, she could not believe that the ruler of a “fussy
little banana republic”—as she was wont to refer contemptuously
to Baracoa—would dare to go to extreme
lengths with a citizen of a country powerful enough
to own such engines of destruction as this.</p>

<p>When the officer of the deck learned her identity
he conducted her at once to the commanding officer’s
cabin. Captain Cortrell had already met her at the
embassy when he had called there to pay his respects
to her father. The smile which came now
to his weather-beaten countenance betokened how delighted
he was to renew the acquaintance; for grim old
sea dog though he was, he was always glad to see a
pretty face aboard his vessel, especially when that
pretty face belonged to one of his own countrywomen.
His smile abruptly disappeared, however, when he<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
learned the object of Virginia’s visit, and he shook
his grizzled head sadly.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, Miss Throgmorton, that I am
powerless to do anything. I sympathize greatly with
Mr. Hawley, and, unofficially, would do anything in
my power to help him, but you must realize that
officially my hands are tied.”</p>

<p>“I don’t realize anything of the sort!” Virginia
cried impetuously. “If you were to go to Portiforo
and tell him that unless he releases your countryman
immediately the <em>Kearsarge’s</em> guns will wipe Baracoa
off the map, I am confident that he would be impressed.”</p>

<p>Captain Cortrell received this suggestion with a
laugh, but that the girl had struck a responsive chord
within him was evident by the glint which came to
his eyes. “I don’t mind admitting that such a step
is exactly the one I’d like to take,” he confided to her.
“But, of course, it is quite out of the question. You
must see that. Your father is in command of the
situation here. I could not presume to go over the
head of the United States minister.”</p>

<p>“This is no time for red tape,” the girl protested.
“What does it matter whose head you go over when
the life of a brave man is in danger?” Her voice
suddenly became softly coaxing. “I feel sure you,
too, are a brave man, Captain Cortrell. Why not take
the chance? Other American commanders have taken
chances.”</p>

<p>The naval officer cut her short with another laugh.
“I hate to forfeit your good opinion, Miss Throgmorton,”<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
he said dryly, “but I am afraid I can’t let
you tempt me to be guilty of such a gross breach
of discipline. Why not try that line of argument on
your father?” he suggested. “I will promise you this
much—if you can persuade him to make a formal
request to me to take steps to bring about Mr. Hawley’s
release, I will proceed to take whatever action
may be necessary, immediately, without waiting to
hear from Washington.”</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head. “I know my father’s disposition
too well to have any hope of being able to
change his mind once it is made up,” she said. Then,
suddenly her face brightened. “Well, anyway, I suppose
it won’t do any harm to try,” she exclaimed.
Without telling Captain Cortrell of the new idea which
had come to her, she hurried from the warship and
back to San Cristobal.</p>

</div>


<p>Minister Throgmorton was still in his library when
Virginia returned. He had sent his report to Washington
and had just received a reply. He was in the
act of opening this dispatch when his daughter entered
the room.</p>

<p>“Father, are you aware that Mr. Hawley was not
alone when he went to take the snapshot at the fortress
last night?” she began abruptly.</p>

<p>The diplomat nodded. “I am informed that he
had a woman confederate with him. But, really, my
dear girl——”</p>

<p>“You have been correctly informed,” Virginia
quickly interrupted. “But did they tell you who the
woman was?”</p>

<p>Her father looked at her searchingly. “No, they
did not. Do you know?”</p>

<p>“I do; and I think that you ought to know, too,
before you fully make up your mind that it will be
impossible to use your influence with the government
to prevent this case from coming to trial. Surely
you wouldn’t want your own daughter to be convicted
as accessory before the fact?”</p>

<p>“My own daughter! Why, what do you mean? It
can’t be possible that you——” He stopped short,
and a look of alarm came to his face.</p>

<p>“Yes; it was I,” the girl announced, her voice as<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
calm as if she had been telling him of a visit to her
milliner. “I accompanied Mr. Hawley to the fortress
last night, and helped him to get his snapshot. You
might as well hear the truth now, for you are bound
to learn it later on when I am brought to trial. For,”
she added, with determination, “I have fully decided
that I must confess my part in the adventure. It
would not be honorable for me to remain silent and
let Mr. Hawley suffer alone, when I am fully as guilty
as he.”</p>

<p>Her father smiled incredulously. “I hate to doubt
your word, Virginia, but I am inclined to believe that
you are inventing this story in the vain hope of
frightening me into helping the rascal.”</p>

<p>“If you doubt me,” said Virginia indignantly, “you
have only to make inquiries at the fortress. Ask the
commandant, or Captain Reyes; they can tell you that
I was there. I told them a story which threw them
off the track as to my part in the adventure and caused
them to let me go, but when they hear my confession
they will have no doubt as to its truth.”</p>

<p>A troubled expression came to the minister’s face.
He got up and paced the room in agitation. “What
made you do it?” he demanded presently. “What motive
could you have for assisting this spy?”</p>

<p>Virginia shrugged her shoulders. “He couldn’t get
his snapshot without an assistant, so I volunteered my
services. The excitement of the adventure appealed
to me. Things have been so slow around here lately.”</p>

<p>Her father scowled. “Do you realize the position
you have put me in?” he exclaimed angrily. “The<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
daughter of the United States minister mixed up in
a conspiracy against the government of a friendly
power! It is intolerable. It is liable to cause international
complications. It may result in my recall.”</p>

<p>“It needn’t do either of these things, if only you
could see your way to do as I have suggested—use
your influence with the government here to have Mr.
Hawley set free without a trial. I’m sure everything
will be all right so far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton scowled again. “That is
quite out of the question,” he began. Then he happened
to glance at the cablegram in his hand which
he had been about to read when his daughter had interrupted
him. The message, which was in cipher,
was very brief. Translated it read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“You must make every fair and legitimate effort,
at your discretion, to obtain Hawley’s release.”</p>
</div>

<p>The United States representative did not have to
consult his code book for the identification of the
name which was signed to the message. He knew
that it was the personal cipher of the President of
the United States.</p>

<p>As he was working out the translation his daughter
took a step toward the door. With an intuitive apprehension
of her purpose he looked up from his
desk. “Where are you going, Virginia?” he asked
uneasily.</p>

<p>“To give myself up to the authorities,” the girl
answered, a resolute tilt to her chin. “I have fully
made up my mind that if Mr. Hawley is going to
suffer I am going to share his punishment with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>“You are going to do nothing of the sort,” her
harassed parent declared peremptorily. He got up
from his chair and took his hat and cane. “Wait
here,” he commanded. “I am going out for a little
while. I forbid you to leave the house until I return.”</p>

<p>“Very well, father,” the girl meekly assented. Her
blue eyes twinkled as she spoke. Something about
the envoy’s manner caused her to believe that she
could guess his destination.</p>

<p>A few minutes after he had gone a young man
visited the embassy. He wore the uniform of a lieutenant
of the United States navy. He wore also an
exceedingly perturbed expression. From the card
which the servant brought, Virginia learned that the
visitor’s name was Ridder, and that he was attached
to the battleship <em>Kearsarge</em>. The servant announced
that the young man desired an audience with the
United States minister, but the girl, hoping that his
business might have something to do with the Camera
Chap, ordered that he be shown into the library.</p>

<p>“My father is not in just now,” she announced.
“Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, not,” Lieutenant Ridder replied. “I
have come to see your father about a friend of mine
who was arrested last night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hawley?”</p>

<p>“Yes; do you know if anything is being done for
him? I am anxious to know whether my telegram
has already brought results.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>“Your telegram?” Virginia exclaimed with eager
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Last night when a mob of chocolate soldiers
marched into the hotel and arrested my friend,” the
naval officer explained, “I sent a dispatch to the managing
editor of the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite>, notifying him
of what had happened. I figured that he might have
a pull with Washington.”</p>

<p>“What a clever idea!” exclaimed Virginia, looking
at him admiringly. “That scheme never even entered
my mind. Did you get a reply?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he assured me that he will do everything in
his power to stir up Washington. I was in hopes
that he might have succeeded in getting the state department
to send word to Minister Throgmorton to
demand Hawley’s release.”</p>

<p>“My father received an official dispatch a short time
ago,” Virginia informed him, “but of course I don’t
know what it contained. Are you a very great friend
of Mr. Hawley’s?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ridder smiled. “Well, that depends on
what you mean by friend. We’ve only met a few
times, but—well, you see, he saved my life once. That
was the first time we met. A gang of toughs had me
down and pretty nearly out. They would have finished
me, I guess, if Hawley hadn’t come along. There
were at least six of them, but he sailed into the bunch
and routed them all. He’s the gamest, whitest chap
I’ve ever met, and now that he’s in trouble I’d go the
limit to help him.”</p>

<p>Virginia regarded him with interest. “I wonder<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
just how far you really would go,” she said, a challenge
in her tone. “If all other measures failed,
would you be willing to land a rescue party to the
jail and get him out by force?”</p>

<p>The naval officer smiled sheepishly. “Are you a
mind reader, Miss Throgmorton? Ever since last
night,” he confided to her, “I’ve been figuring whether
that very thing couldn’t be done, if things should come
to a pinch. I know I could pick out at least a dozen
men on the <em>Kearsarge</em> who would be eager to help me.
The only difficulty is that if I took them in on the
scheme it would get them into trouble.”</p>

<p>“It would get you into trouble, too,” the girl reminded
him. “I am afraid that, at the very least, it
would cost you your commission.”</p>

<p>Ridder smiled. “Possibly it would,” he said simply,
“but—well, didn’t Hawley risk more than that
when he sailed into that bunch down in Chinatown and
saved me from being beaten to death? As I said before,
I’m willing to go the limit to help him.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure that you would,” said Virginia, noting
with admiration the breadth of his shoulders and the
strong set of his jaw. “Mr. Hawley is indeed fortunate
to have such a loyal friend so near at hand.
Let us hope, however,” she added, “that such desperate
measures will not be necessary. I have an idea, Mr.
Ridder, that my father has gone now to the national
palace to interview President Portiforo on behalf of
our friend. When he returns he may have good news
for us.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">PORTIFORO’S WAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As he told Virginia, Minister Throgmorton had
been to the arsenal early that morning to talk with the
Camera Chap, but the interview was brief. Finding
the prisoner evasive and uncommunicative, the United
States representative had left in a rage, mistaking
Hawley’s attitude for brazen indifference to his fate.</p>

<p>With the exception of this visitor and Lopez, the
prisoner was permitted to receive no callers. Lieutenant
Ridder, who had visited the arsenal shortly
after his friend’s arrest and demanded to see him, was
politely but firmly informed that, according to the
rules and regulations, Señor Hawley, by the nature of
the charge against him, was strictly denied visitors,
and although the naval officer resorted to both pleading
and threats, he was unable to change this decision.</p>

<p>Although Hawley was by no means an unsociable
man, he was glad that this rule was in force, for ever
since his arrest he had feared that Virginia Throgmorton
might be indiscreet enough to come to see him.
Even as it was, knowing the girl’s loyal and impulsive
nature, he was afraid that she might manage, by the
use of her father’s influence, to obtain the necessary
permission to visit him. Such an interview, he felt
sure, would be disastrous, for he had no doubt that
every word that passed between them would be eagerly
listened to by Portiforo’s spies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>Consequently, when late that afternoon he heard
footsteps in the cement-walled courtyard upon which
the door of his dungeon opened, and, peering through
the bars, caught sight of the figure of a woman approaching
his cell, his heart skipped a couple of beats.
The woman, who was flanked on either side by a uniformed
official, wore a heavy veil, but as she drew
near she threw aside this covering, and an involuntary
exclamation of dismay escaped from the Camera
Chap’s lips as he caught sight of her features.</p>

<p>The visitor was not Virginia. Recognizing that
pathetic, haggard face at first glance, the prisoner
would have been relieved at that moment to have seen
the daughter of the United States minister standing
there in her place; for if Virginia’s visit to the jail
would have been an unwise step, the presence of this
woman was a hundred times more so. He marveled
at the madness which had caused Señora Felix to come
to see him—for he supposed at first that it was on his
account that she was there.</p>

<p>Greatly to his surprise and relief, however, the
señora and her companions passed his cell without
even a glance at him. As she went by he observed
that tears were streaming down her cheeks and that
her frail form was trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>They halted at a cell on the same tier, a few yards
away, and the two officials withdrew a short distance,
leaving the woman to talk with its occupant through
the bars. The Camera Chap could not see her now,
but he heard her burst suddenly into a fit of violent
sobbing. Then he heard a man say soothingly:<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
“Courage, señora! I entreat you to be calm, my dear
friend. Surely you who have faced all your tribulations
with such sublime bravery are not going to break
down now.”</p>

<p>At the sound of that patient, softly modulated voice,
Hawley gave a start of surprise. He felt positive that
he recognized it as the voice of Doctor Gaspard Bonsal.
Until that moment he had been unaware of the
identity of any of his fellow captives, and the possibility
that the venerable physician might be confined
in the arsenal jail had not occurred to him, for he
had heard that he had been sent to El Torro.</p>

<p>Although, under other circumstances, he would have
been averse to playing the rôle of eavesdropper, he
could not help now straining his ears in an effort to
catch the conversation which passed between the
señora and her devoted old friend, for he had an uneasy
suspicion of what her visit and her great grief
portended. They spoke mostly in such low tones that
what they said did not reach him, but once Doctor
Bonsal unconsciously raised his voice, and the Camera
Chap heard him say. “I am old, my child, and
what happens to me does not matter. We must accept
the situation with philosophy.”</p>

<p>“If only I could do something,” the woman sobbed.
“I have been to Portiforo and pleaded with him, but
it was no use. He would not listen. That tyrant——”</p>

<p>She stopped short at a remonstrance from the
physician, spoken in a voice so low that Hawley could
not catch the words. Almost immediately after that
the two officials stepped up to the señora and gruffly<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
informed her that it was time for her to withdraw.
The Camera Chap heard her plead with them to be allowed
to have a few more words with the prisoner, but
the request was refused, and, sobbing violently, she
was literally dragged from in front of the barred door.</p>

<p>The next morning Hawley’s fears for the old physician
were confirmed in a startling manner. At sunrise
the tramp of many feet resounded on the stone floor
of the courtyard, and he heard a hoarse voice exclaim:
“<i lang="es">Adelante!</i>” Knowing that this order was the Spanish
equivalent for “Forward, march!” he was not surprised,
upon jumping from his bed and gazing through
the bars, to see a file of soldiers in the courtyard.
There were about twenty of them. At the command
of the officer they ranged themselves at one end of
the yard and stood at attention, as unconcerned as
though they had come there to perform their usual
morning drill. Presently Hawley heard voices to the
right of his cell. “Are you ready?” somebody asked.
Then, in a voice which thrilled the listener, Doctor
Bonsal answered unfalteringly: “I am ready.”</p>

<p>A gate creaked on its hinges, and the venerable
prisoner, his head held high, his shoulders squared,
walked past the Camera Chap’s door, an army officer
in dress uniform on each side of him.</p>

<p>Like a man in a dream, the snapshot adventurer
gazed upon the scene that followed. He saw the
officers place their victim with his back to the cement
wall of the courtyard, and tie a handkerchief over his
eyes. He saw them step back, and heard one of them
give an order which caused the long line of gleaming<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
rifle barrels at the other end of the yard to rise with
a precision that seemed almost automatic. In another
minute the tragedy was over, and in ten minutes the
courtyard was clear, and the routine of the prison was
resumed.</p>

<p>Hawley was horrified at what he had witnessed, but
his predominant emotion was one of violent rage. “If
ever I get out of here,” he murmured, “I’ll make
Portiforo pay for this.” Then he smiled grimly as
the thought came to him that instead of getting out,
the chances were that before long he himself would be
in the same position as the ill-fated Doctor Bonsal.</p>

<p>Presently two men came to his cell and threw open
the door. “Señor,” one of them said politely, “we
must request you to be good enough to accompany
us.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">OLD SCORES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Since the publication in the New York <cite>Daily News</cite>
of the letters of the missing President Felix to his
wife, Gale had stood high in the favor of Portiforo.
The latter had sent for the reporter and assured him
of his deep appreciation of the service he had rendered
the government of Baracoa by disposing so effectively
of the unpleasant rumors concerning Felix,
the circulation of which had been a source of distress
to him, Portiforo, and the high-minded patriotic gentlemen
connected with his administration. Incidentally
he had told Gale that the latchstring of the national
palace was at all times out for him.</p>

<p>On the day that he learned of the Camera Chap’s
arrest, Gale decided to take advantage of this standing
invitation. He deemed it his duty to have a chat with
the president concerning the prisoner. He found
Portiforo not at all unwilling to talk on that subject.</p>

<p>“In fact, Señor Gale, if you had not come, I was
about to send for you for that very purpose,” said
the president, when his visitor had made known the
object of his call. “I am desirous of getting some information
about that misguided young man, and since
you and he are members of the same profession, you
ought to be able to tell me what I want to know. I
am informed,” he went on, somewhat anxiously, “that
this man Hawley is quite a big figure in American
journalism—a sort of a celebrity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>Gale laughed disdainfully. “I don’t know where
you could have got hold of that idea, Señor Presidente.
A celebrity, eh? Well, that’s pretty good!”</p>

<p>He spoke with malicious emphasis, for he believed
that he understood his questioner’s motive in seeking
to ascertain the status of the Camera Chap in the
newspaper world. If he was convinced that Hawley
was a man of prominence in his own country he would
probably hesitate to go to extremes with him for fear
of bringing upon himself the wrath of the American
people. If, on the other hand, he was led to believe
that the prisoner was a person of no great importance,
the latter was likely to receive scant consideration from
him.</p>

<p>Realizing that here was an opportunity to settle old
scores with his rival, Gale eagerly availed himself of
it. “You can take it from me, Señor Presidente,” he
declared, “that Hawley is nothing but a plain, ordinary
camera man, and in the newspaper business camera
men don’t rank very high. We reporters rather look
down on them.”</p>

<p>The president looked surprised. “Then it isn’t true
that he gets an enormous salary, and that his brilliant
exploits have made him so famous that even
the President of the United States has been known
to employ his services in diplomatic work?” As Portiforo
asked the question he looked keenly at the reporter.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” the latter answered. “Who’s been
filling you up with such trash as that? The President<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
of the United States doesn’t employ newspaper men
for diplomatic work,” he added, unaware of the good
turn he was really doing the man he desired to injure.
“There are lots of secret-service men who understand
how to use a camera. If the president required any
photographic work of a diplomatic nature, he’d employ
one of them, of course.”</p>

<p>Portiforo was considerably impressed by the logic
of this argument. For a few seconds he puffed reflectively
on his cigar. “Do you happen to know,
Señor Gale, why Hawley came to Baracoa?” he inquired
suddenly. “The real reason, I mean. Did anybody
send him, or did he come here of his own accord?”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of the reporter’s tongue to tell
his questioner the truth about Hawley’s mission so
far as he knew it, for he realized that such information
was not likely to prejudice Portiforo in the prisoner’s
favor. But fortunately for the cause for which his
rival had made such sacrifices, he did not yield to this
impulse. On second thought he decided that more
was to be gained by supporting the accusation that the
Camera Chap was an insurrecto spy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do happen to know why he came to Baracoa,
Señor Presidente,” he answered. “He came here
of his own accord to help the revolutionists. He made
no secret of his purpose in New York. He boasted to
several of the men on Park Row of his friendship for
that rascal Rodriguez. He said that there was going
to be a revolution in Baracoa and that he was going
to help things along with his camera. You are aware,<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
of course, that he and Rodriguez left New York together
and arrived here on the same boat?”</p>

<p>Portiforo nodded. “Yes; that significant fact naturally
did not escape our notice. Still——” he paused,
and a puzzled frown darkened his beefy countenance—“what
you have told me is most interesting, Señor
Gale,” he said, leaving unspoken the thought that had
been in his mind. “I am deeply indebted to you for
the information you have given. It has enabled me
to decide what course I shall pursue regarding that
wretched young man.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said the reporter, a glint in
his eyes. “You can go as far as you like with him,
Señor Presidente, without any fear of angering the
government of my country.”</p>

<p>The president smiled sardonically. “It seems to
me, my dear friend, that you are not exactly fond of
your countryman.”</p>

<p>“I must admit that I haven’t any use for him,” the
other responded. “But I am not alone in my prejudice.
Every self-respecting newspaper man in New York
who has had dealing with the fellow feels the same
way about him. We regard him as one of the black
sheep of our profession.”</p>

<p>Portiforo appeared pleased to hear this. “If that
is the way your brother journalists regard him I presume
that his fate will not cause a great outcry from
the press which is so influential in your country?”</p>

<p>“Of course it won’t,” the newspaper man eagerly
assured him. “The scamp has been mixed up in so
many shady transactions that we’ve all been expecting<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
to see him come to a bad end. Of course, you must
expect that his own paper, the <cite>Sentinel</cite>, will try to
stir up a fuss about him; but, then, nobody pays any
attention to what that sensational sheet says or does.”</p>

<p>Portiforo expressed surprise at this. “I had been
under the impression that the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite> was
one of the most influential journals in the United
States,” he said.</p>

<p>“You have been misinformed,” Gale returned. “It
has a fair-sized circulation, but its readers consist
mostly of the more unintelligent classes.” He leaned
forward in his chair. “You can take it from me,
Señor Presidente, that if that rascally camera man gets
his deserts the better portion of our press will heartily
approve of what you have done as soon as the facts
become known. And I shall make it my business to see
that the facts are known,” he added significantly. “I
am returning to the United States on next Wednesday’s
boat—my editor has sent me word that he positively
cannot get along without me any longer—and
when I get to New York it will give me great pleasure
to combat with my pen any adverse sentiment which
the <cite>Sentinel</cite> may try to create against your government.”</p>

<p>“That is most kind of you, my dear Señor Gale,”
the president declared gratefully. “You are indeed a
true friend of Baracoa. With such a distinguished
journalist enlisted on the side of truth I have no fear
of being misunderstood by the people of your great
nation.”</p>

<p>He slipped from one of his pudgy fingers a massive<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
gold ring set with a huge diamond. “Since you
are about to leave us,” he said, handing the piece of
jewelry to his visitor, “I beg you to accept this as a
small token of my esteem and gratitude.”</p>

<p>Gale left the palace well satisfied with the result of
his visit. “Guess the boys on Park Row will think this
is pretty poor.” He chuckled, gazing at the gem which
glistened on his finger with all the pleasure of a
woman. But what pleased him much more than the
president’s valuable gift was the thought of what influence
his conversation with Portiforo was likely to
have upon the fate of the man whom he hated more
than anybody else in the world. “I rather think I’ve
settled Frank Hawley’s hash,” he told himself delightedly.</p>

<p>Shortly after Gale’s departure from the palace,
Minister Throgmorton arrived, and was closeted with
the president for over an hour. The interview was
at times a stormy one. It was as a result of that conference
that the Camera Chap, the next morning, was
visited by two men who threw open the door of his cell
and bade him accompany them.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">AT THE PALACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hawley believed that almost anything outrageous
was possible after the terrible scene he had witnessed
in the courtyard of the jail, and he accompanied his
own visitors with some misgivings, which, however, he
took pains to conceal from them.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” he said, with well-simulated
carelessness, as they invited him to enter an automobile
with a closed top which was standing outside the
jail, “I’d like to know where you’re taking me? I’m
naturally of a rather curious disposition.”</p>

<p>“To the national palace, señor,” one of the men
answered. “The president sent us for you.”</p>

<p>The prisoner’s face grew grim. He thought he
could guess the reason for this summons. Disappointed
at Lopez’s inability to get the truth about the
snapshot expedition, Portiforo was going to try his
own skill as a cross-examiner. The Camera Chap had
no doubt that the president of Baracoa was a past
master at the gentle art of administering the third
degree, but he was fully resolved that if Portiforo
hoped to get anything out of him he was going to be
greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>Arriving at the palace in a decidedly belligerent
mood, which was intensified by his contempt for the
man of whose brutality he had just had such startling
evidence, he was somewhat astonished by the graciousness<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
with which he was received. Portiforo was seated
in the audience chamber, a large room furnished in
massive mahogany and hung with rich Oriental
draperies. Near the president sat Minister Throgmorton,
whose scowling face was in sharp contrast to the
smile which illuminated the former’s rubicund countenance.
The only other person present was a dark-skinned
young man who sat at a big writing table in
the center of the room, chewing the end of a pencil,
with a stenographer’s notebook before him.</p>

<p>“So this is Señor Hawley,” Portiforo began quizzically,
when the Camera Chap’s two guides had conducted
him to a position in front of the massive,
thronelike chair in which the first gentleman of Baracoa
lolled. “So this is the adventurous young man
whose discretion, I fear, is not always as great as
his valor.”</p>

<p>To this the prisoner did not deem it worth while to
make any reply. He merely looked straight into the
tyrant’s beady eyes, his muscles tense, his mouth set
in a straight line.</p>

<p>“I am always glad to gaze upon genius,” Portiforo
continued, without a vestige of irony in his tone, “and
I am informed, Señor Hawley, that you are such a
great man in your line that even the President of the
United States has honored you by providing work for
your camera.”</p>

<p>Grasping the significance of this question, and conscious
of the fact that the other’s gaze was riveted
searchingly upon his face, Hawley was keenly on his
guard. “I have had the honor of photographing the<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
President of the United States, if that is what you
mean,” he replied coldly.</p>

<p>His evident miscomprehension of the question
seemed to please Portiforo.</p>

<p>“No; that was not quite what I meant,” the latter
said, after a slight pause. “However, we will let it
go at that. I presume, señor,” he continued, “you
are wondering why I sent for you?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are in hopes that this summons may
mean that, in spite of the seriousness of your offense,
you are to receive mercy?”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” Hawley exclaimed, with an ironical laugh.
“No, I scarcely expect that, sir—after the scene I witnessed
in the prison yard this morning. I hardly think
you know what mercy means.”</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton’s scowl deepened, but the
president’s face did not lose its smile as he turned to
the stenographer at the table, who had already started
to make a record of the conversation. “I don’t think
you need put that down, Garcia,” he said good-humoredly.
“I feel confident that Señor Hawley will
wish to withdraw that remark later on.”</p>

<p>He addressed himself once more to the man before
him. “I presume, señor, you refer to the execution of
the traitor Bonsal. That was indeed a sad affair, and
I regret that you should have been compelled to behold
it. I think, however, that you are unjust in calling
it an outrage. The unhappy man met only his
just deserts. He was found guilty, after a fair trial,
of conspiring against the government of his adopted<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
country. His fate was the fate which all traitors must
expect.” His small eyes twinkled. “Perhaps, however,
you will change your mind about my ignorance
of the meaning of the word mercy,” he said dryly,
“when I tell you that, in spite of the seriousness of
your own offense, I have decided to let you go free.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>“The worthy representative of your country here,”
Portiforo continued, with a bow in the direction of
the envoy, “has been kind enough to exert his personal
influence in your behalf. While he fully agrees with
me that officially he has absolutely no rights in the
matter—that the nature of your crime puts you outside
the protection of your government and permits us
to do with you as we see fit, my esteem for Señor
Throgmorton is so great that I have decided to grant
his request to set you free, since he has asked it of
me as a personal favor to him.”</p>

<p>The prisoner, scarcely able to believe that what he
heard was true, turned with a grateful smile to the
American diplomat. “This is very good of you, sir,”
he began.</p>

<p>Minister Throgmorton silenced him with a curt gesture.
“You can spare me your thanks,” he said, his
face still maintaining its frozen expression. “I want
you to understand clearly that my intercession is not
prompted by any sympathy for you. On the contrary,
I feel that whatever sentence the court might see
fit to pass upon you would be no more than you richly
deserve. I consider you, sir, a disgrace to your country
and to the honorable profession which has the misfortune<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
to number you among its members. My action
in procuring your pardon is due entirely to—er—to
other reasons.”</p>

<p>The president smiled appreciatively, and his glance,
wandering over to the table, noted that the official
stenographer was taking down every word of this
caustic speech.</p>

<p>“You will observe, Señor Hawley,” he remarked
pointedly, “that were your own countryman in my
place, you could scarcely expect to receive the leniency
which I am showing you. Perhaps, now, you are
ready to withdraw the intemperate remark you made
a little while ago about my mercy?”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled shrewdly. “I think I had
better wait until I have heard the conditions on which
I am to get my release. I suppose there will be
conditions?”</p>

<p>“The only condition,” said Portiforo, frowning at
this cold response, “is that you get out of this country
immediately. We will give you until to-morrow.
There is a boat leaving for New York in the morning.
If you are caught on Baracoan soil after that—well,
what you saw take place in the prison yard this
morning ought to give you a graphic idea of what
you will have to expect.”</p>

<p>Hawley opened his mouth as though about to say
something, but changed his mind and merely bowed.</p>

<p>“And I warn you that next time,” said Minister
Throgmorton sharply, “if you expect any help from
me you are going to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>Portiforo chuckled. “I feel confident that there<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
isn’t going to be any next time, eh, Mr. Hawley? As
a man of common sense, you are no doubt fully convinced
of the inadvisability of doing any more camera
work in Baracoa.”</p>

<p>“Could I stay if I were to give you my word that
I wouldn’t use my camera while in this country?” the
snapshot adventurer inquired.</p>

<p>The president grinned and shook his head. “Señor
Hawley is such a great camera enthusiast that we
should have cause to fear that he might be tempted to
forget such a promise,” he said dryly. “No; greatly
as I regret having to be so inhospitable, we must insist
upon your leaving Baracoa.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap bowed. “Very well, sir; I shall
sail on to-morrow’s boat,” he said. His air was so
much like that of one who feels that he is driving a
hard bargain, that Minister Throgmorton commented
upon it angrily. “Anybody would think that you
weren’t satisfied!” he exclaimed. “You are without
exception the most impertinent and ungrateful fellow
I have ever met.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry if I appear that way,” Hawley responded
simply. “I assure you, sir, that I am not ungrateful
to you and Señor Portiforo for this unexpected
clemency.”</p>

<p>The president chuckled. “There is one other person
to whom you are indebted for your good fortune,”
he announced dryly.</p>

<p>“Who is that?”</p>

<p>“Your brother journalist, Señor Gale. He was
here yesterday to see me concerning you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>“To intercede for me?” Hawley exclaimed, scarcely
able to conceal his astonishment.</p>

<p>Portiforo smiled. “He gave me some information
concerning you which had a great influence upon me,”
he said vaguely. “In fact, if it had not been for the
arguments he advanced, I don’t think I should have
decided to grant you freedom, even to oblige my dear
friend Señor Throgmorton.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">BLUE SPECTACLES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Gale told Virginia Throgmorton that he had
a cablegram from his office asking him to return to
New York and report for duty immediately, the girl
received the tidings with an equanimity which was not
at all flattering to his pride.</p>

<p>“Won’t you be sorry to see me go?” he queried.
Although his host’s pretty daughter had taken no
pains to conceal her dislike for him, his egotism was
so strong that he found it difficult to believe that he
really was not in her good graces.</p>

<p>“I think I shall be able to survive the blow,” Virginia
answered lightly.</p>

<p>The reporter frowned. “You didn’t feel that way
about me when I first came here, Virginia,” he said
reproachfully. “You and I got along together famously
at first. It was only when that scamp Hawley
first showed his face in San Cristobal that I began
to lose my pull with you.”</p>

<p>Virginia gave him a scornful glance. “Mr. Hawley
isn’t a scamp,” she replied indignantly. “And he
didn’t have anything to do with your losing your pull
with me, as you term it. I had already found you out
before he arrived.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a mystery to me why you seem to be so
strong for that fellow,” Gale protested, ignoring the
last part of her remark. “I should think, after the<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
trick he played you with those Felix letters, you
wouldn’t have any use for him.”</p>

<p>The girl stared at him wonderingly. “Have you
the effrontery to keep on claiming that Mr. Hawley
stole those letters from my desk, when they appeared
in your own paper!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s easily explained,” he rejoined coolly. “He
sold the letters to my paper. He didn’t dare sell them
to his own, for fear that if he did the crime would
be traced straight to him. A fellow with as little conscience
as he has wouldn’t hesitate to scoop his own
sheet in order to make a few dollars. If you don’t
think he was the thief,” he added audaciously, “who
do you suppose was?”</p>

<p>“If I wished to name the thief, I feel confident that
I could do so,” Virginia returned disdainfully.</p>

<p>Gale’s expression was one of injured innocence.
“From your tone, I almost think that you suspect me,”
he said. “That’s pretty tough, Virginia—giving that
crook the benefit of the doubt in preference to me.
Since you persist in being so cruel,” he went on plaintively,
“I am almost glad to go back to New York.
Without your friendship, San Cristobal is a dull burg.”
His eyes gleamed spitefully. “My only regret at having
to leave Baracoa at this time is that I shan’t be
here to see that rascally Camera Chap stood up in front
of a firing squad.”</p>

<p>With this kindly remark he went out to see about
booking his passage home. As he drew near the steamship
office he received the greatest surprise of his
life. Two men were just coming out of the place.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
One of them wore the uniform of a lieutenant in the
United States navy. The other, who was in civilian
garb, was a tall, slim young man whose pale face offered
a striking contrast to his companion’s ruddy
countenance. Gale stared at the latter with as much
amazement as if he had been gazing upon a ghost, and
his surprise was not diminished when the tall man,
recognizing him, came eagerly toward him with his
hand outstretched and a smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you, old man, for what you’ve done
for me,” he said warmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” the reporter couldn’t help exclaiming
blankly.</p>

<p>“I understand that it is largely to you that I owe
my freedom. It was mighty white of you, Gale, to
go to Portiforo on my behalf. I shan’t forget it in
a hurry.”</p>

<p>Gale felt somewhat uncomfortable, suspecting that
what he heard must be irony. But there was no mistaking
the sincerity of the other’s manner, and, as
soon as he was convinced of this, the <cite>News</cite> man
grasped the outstretched hand with well-simulated cordiality.
He was greatly puzzled by this queer situation,
but, possessing remarkable rallying powers, he
quickly recovered his self-possession. “Don’t mention
it, Hawley, old fellow,” he said, “I am glad to see
you free. Who told you that I had a hand in getting
you out?” he inquired, his manner implying that he
would greatly have preferred to have his good act
shrouded in anonymity.</p>

<p>“Portiforo told me,” was the amazing answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>“The deuce!” Gale muttered. “I can’t understand
why he should have told you that?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true?” the other exclaimed, in an astonished
tone.</p>

<p>The reporter smiled. “Oh, yes; it’s true enough.
When I heard about your being in trouble, I figured
that my pull with Portiforo might do you some good,
so I hiked to the palace and did my little best to give
you a boost. But,” he added, with a show of vexation,
“I can’t understand why the president should have told
you of my humble efforts. He promised that he
wouldn’t mention it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad that he did,” the Camera Chap said impulsively.
“It was a mighty decent thing for you to
do, Gale, considering that the relations between us
have been—er—somewhat strained. Without meaning
any offense, I’d like to know why you did it?”</p>

<p>The <cite>News</cite> man shrugged his shoulders. “After all,
blood is thicker than water,” he responded sentimentally.
“I couldn’t stand by and see a countryman of
mine made a target for Baracoan bullets, when it was
in my power to save him, even though that countryman
hadn’t acted quite fairly to me in the past. Hang
it all! I flatter myself I’m big enough to do a good
turn even for an enemy.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not going to be enemies any longer,”
the good-natured snapshot expert declared, once more
impulsively offering his hand to his supposed benefactor,
who accepted it without a qualm.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ridder, who had encountered Hawley
outside the national palace, and accompanied him to the<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
steamship office, had listened to this conversation with
some surprise. “Who’s your friend, Frank?” he inquired
with a frown, after they had left Gale. “I
can’t say that I’m stuck on his looks. On first impression,
I’d size him up as a mighty slippery proposition.
And as for owing your liberty to him, I think
you’re mistaken about that. I know of somebody else
who deserves most of the credit.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” the Camera Chap demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>The naval officer’s eyes twinkled. “It isn’t a he—it’s
a young woman. I wonder if you could guess her
name.”</p>

<p>“Miss Throgmorton?”</p>

<p>“Good guess,” Ridder chuckled. “Yes; it was the
United States minister’s daughter that did the trick
for you. She forced her father to use his influence
with Portiforo.”</p>

<p>“Forced him? How do you know?”</p>

<p>“She told me so herself. I suppose she’d be angry
with me if she knew I was telling you a word about
it, but I think it only right that you should hear of
her efforts in your behalf. She went to her governor
and told him that if you were guilty she was guilty
also, as she had assisted you to take that mysterious
snapshot—she didn’t tell me what it was—and that
unless you were set free she was going to give herself
up to the authorities as accessory before the fact.
There’s some class to a girl who’ll go that far to help
a friend.”</p>

<p>“Some class!” Hawley repeated, a tender look in<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
his eyes. “Say! She’s the pluckiest, whitest girl I
ever met.”</p>

<p>The navy man grinned. “Well, you and she could
form a mutual admiration society,” he confided to his
companion. “You certainly stand high with her, old
man. She——”</p>

<p>He stopped short at a sharp exclamation from his
companion. To his surprise he observed that, although
his remark ought to have been of great interest to the
latter, he was paying no attention to it. They were
walking along the Avenida Bolivar, and the camera
man’s gaze was directed toward a man on the opposite
side of the wide street. This man wore the
uniform of an officer of the Baracoan army, and he
wore spectacles of dark-blue glass.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty queer,” Ridder heard his companion
mutter.</p>

<p>“Are you referring to the glasses?” the sailor inquired.
“It is rather odd to find a fellow in the
service with such weak sight. In our own army they’d
retire him for disability, but I suppose anything is
good enough for Baracoa. Do you know who the fellow
is? He seems to know you from the way he’s
staring over here.”</p>

<p>Hawley nodded. “Yes, I know him; his name is
Reyes—Captain Ernesto Reyes, of the engineers. But
what puzzles me is why he should be wearing those
goggles. He didn’t wear any glasses at all a couple
of days ago.”</p>

<p>A little later the two men parted company, Ridder<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
announcing that he had to go back to the ship. Much
as he liked him, Hawley was not sorry to be rid of him
just then. He was eager to make a call at the United
States legation, and as the person he hoped to see
there was not Minister Throgmorton, he preferred to
go alone. When he arrived at the legation, a disappointment
awaited him. The old colored servant informed
him that Miss Virginia was not at home.</p>

<p>The visitor was surprised and chagrined to hear
this, as a glimpse he had caught of a pretty face at
one of the upper windows apprised him that this announcement
was not to be taken literally. His face
lighted up, however, at some supplementary information
which the servant imparted to him. “Miss Virginia
is not at home now, sir,” the old darky repeated
with a broad grin, “but,” he added in a mysterious
whisper, “she’s gwine out horseback ridin’ this afternoon.
She done tol’ me to be sure and tell you that.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, Hawley hired a mount and met his
fair ally at the old trysting place. The girl had dismounted
and was standing in the middle of the road
talking to her steed as though he were a human being,
when the Camera Chap galloped up. She ran eagerly
to meet him, both her hands outstretched and her eyes
shining joyously.</p>

<p>“This is almost too good to be true,” she cried, as
he jumped from his horse. “When I heard what they
did to poor Doctor Bonsal this morning, I was half
crazy with fear on your account. You certainly have
had a narrow escape, Mr. Hawley.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I understand that I owe it largely to you<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
that I am now free,” he said, his voice trembling. “I
can’t begin to tell you how much I——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” she interrupted, a rosy tinge making
itself visible beneath her fair skin. “Who told you
that? It is to the President of the United States that
you owe your freedom.”</p>

<p>“The president!” the Camera Chap cried.</p>

<p>Virginia smiled. “Didn’t my father tell you that?
Well, it’s the truth. He didn’t tell it to me, either;
but he received a code message from the White House
yesterday, and he was so careless as to leave it on his
desk when he went out. I suppose I ought to be very
much ashamed of myself, but my curiosity forced me
to work out the translation with the aid of the code
book. What a very important man you must be, Mr.
Hawley, to have the president so concerned about you.
But tell me what happened at the palace! What did
that tyrant have to say to you?”</p>

<p>Her companion laughed. “I must say, in justice to
him, that he didn’t act much like a tyrant to-day. If
it hadn’t been for the things we know about him, I
would almost have thought from the way he treated
me that he really was the genial, benevolent old gentleman
he looks to be when his face is in repose.”</p>

<p>“Did he exact any promise from you in return for
your release?” the girl inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Only one. I am to leave Baracoa on to-morrow’s
boat.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s face clouded. “Of course, I expected
that,” she said, with a sigh. “Still, it’s a great pity
that you have to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>Her words brought a joyous expression to Hawley’s
face. “Do you really care?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I care,” she answered, her color deepening;
“but not on my own account—at least,” she added,
with sweet candor, “not wholly on my own account.
I was thinking of poor President Felix. You are
going to leave him to his fate? Of course, I don’t
blame you for going,” she explained quickly, observing
the hurt expression which came to his face. “It
would be suicide for you to stay after what has happened,
and you have already made enough sacrifices
in his behalf. Still, it does seem a great pity that we
can’t do anything for him—that all our efforts should
have been for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does seem a great pity,” the Camera Chap
agreed. “Tell me, Miss Throgmorton,” he said with
apparent irrelevancy, “do you happen to know what
is the matter with Captain Reyes’ eyes? I saw him
on the Avenida Bolivar to-day, and he was wearing
spectacles with thick blue lenses.”</p>

<p>Virginia frowned, as though she resented this evident
attempt on his part to change the subject. “Yes,
I have seen them,” she replied coldly, “I met him this
morning as he was returning from the oculist. He
had been complaining of weak eyes for some time, and
yesterday the specialist ordered those glasses. But
what has that got to do with poor President Felix?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, of course,” Hawley answered with a
queer smile. “Nothing whatever. I was merely curious
about those blue spectacles.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">WIRELESS WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Just as the steamship <em>Eldorado</em>, bound for New
York, was about to leave her dock at Puerto Cabero,
a touring car with a closed top dashed up to the wharf,
and two women alighted and went aboard the ship.
One of this pair, whose slender form was clad in
black, wore a heavy veil which concealed her features,
but Hawley, who was standing near the gangway when
they arrived, gave a start of surprise. Despite the
veil, he recognized the women as Señora Felix and her
maid. The Camera Chap had not heard that the wife
of the ex-president was to be among his fellow passengers.
Later on, he learned that her departure from
her native land was not a voluntary act. Her husband’s
successor to the presidency had sent her a curt
notice the day before that the government of Baracoa
expected her to sail on the <em>Eldorado</em>, and that if
she saw fit to disappoint the government’s expectation
in this respect, she might have to stand trial on the
painful charge of being in league with the government’s
enemies.</p>

<p>Although Hawley did not know at the time that the
unfortunate woman was an exile, he could see from
the way in which her slender form trembled that she
was under stress of great emotion, and his heart was
filled with sympathy for her, but although she passed
close to where he was standing, he did not attempt<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
to address her or even to salute her. He was keenly
alive to the fact that he was an object of close scrutiny
from several keen-eyed swarthy men who stood on the
pier, and he realized the great necessity of treating the
señora as a total stranger while they were looking on.
But later, as the boat was passing out of the bay, and
the Camera Chap stood against the rail of the promenade
deck, gazing with mixed sensations at the grim,
gray walls of El Torro fortress, he became suddenly
aware that somebody was standing close beside him,
and, turning, discovered Señora Felix.</p>

<p>The woman leaned over the rail, and her eyes were
fixed yearningly on the fortress. She had raised her
veil, and the sympathetic young man beside her could
see the tears running down her haggard face. A sound
as though she were choking came from her throat.</p>

<p>They were all alone. The rest of the passengers
were on the other side of the deck absorbed in watching
and waving salutes to the American battleship,
which was an object of greater interest to them than
the fortress. Under cover of this privacy, the Camera
Chap thought there would be no harm in whispering
a word of comfort to his unhappy neighbor.
But, to his amazement, at the first sound of his voice,
she wheeled on him with the fury of a tigress. “You!”
she cried, her eyes blazing, her voice quavering with
rage. “How dare you presume to address me after
what you have done? Are you so lacking in shame,
sir, that you would intrude upon the grief of a woman
whose nearest and dearest you and your selfish government
have murdered?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>“My dear señora!” the president’s photographic
envoy protested gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, murdered!” the frantic woman repeated
fiercely, paying no heed to his interruption. “Your
intolerable interference amounts to that. Things were
bad enough before you came to Baracoa, at least, there
was some hope then. But now—now——” Her voice
broke, and she covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“My dear señora,” the Camera Chap repeated, taking
advantage of this lull in the storm of denunciation,
“I regret exceedingly that you should feel so bitter
toward me, for I assure you—empty as the words may
sound—that I would gladly give up my life to serve
you and your husband.”</p>

<p>If the poor woman had been in a saner mood, she
would have realized that the man who uttered these
words had already proved the sincerity of them by
the great risk he had run for her cause, but she merely
laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Your life, señor!” she cried. “Such a sacrifice
as that was not required of you. All that you were
asked to do was to give up your selfish ambition—to
go back to your heartless president and tell him that
the life of a noble man and a woman’s broken heart
were far more important in your eyes than a laurel
for your own brow and a diplomatic triumph for your
government. But you refused to listen to the pleadings
of a devoted wife. You persisted in going ahead
with your ruthless, blundering plans, not caring what
might happen to your victim so long as you could<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
boast to the world of your wonderful snapshot achievement.”</p>

<p>Hawley saw that there was no use in trying to defend
himself by pointing out to her that he had not
made his unsuccessful attempt until he had been led
to believe, from his conversation with the commander
of the United States battleship, that the captive of El
Torro would be protected after the snapshot had been
taken, and that, moreover, it was the information
which had come to him concerning the precarious condition
of General Replife’s health which had caused
him to decide that desperate measures were absolutely
necessary. In her present mood, he realized, such
argument would have been useless. Besides, his
thought was not to defend himself against her bitter
accusations. Big-hearted chap that he was, his sole
desire was to comfort her, if that were possible.</p>

<p>“Tell me, señora,” he begged, after an anxious
glance at the group of passengers crowded against the
opposite rail, “do you know definitely that anything
has happened to President Felix, or are you merely giving
expression to your apprehensions?”</p>

<p>Again she laughed bitterly. “Is it not to be taken
for granted that the consequence of your mad act of
the other night would be the assassination of my husband?
Do you suppose for a minute that those ruffians
would let him live now that they are aware that
their secret is known?”</p>

<p>“But you do not know of his death?” the Camera
Chap persisted. “You have not actually heard that
they have done what you fear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>She shook her head. “No, I have not heard,” she
said wearily. “It is scarcely to be supposed that they
would proclaim their crime to the whole world. Assassins
are not in the habit of advertising their deeds,
señor.”</p>

<p>Her reply relieved him of a great fear which her
previous utterances had created in his mind. “Let us
hope that your anxiety is groundless,” he said soothingly.
“I suppose, señora, you have heard the good
news from the hospital. It was announced to-day that
the condition of the minister of war is much improved.
He surprised the surgeons by rallying when
they thought there was no hope, and now they say
that he is practically out of danger. And Replife’s life
means President Felix’s life. Now that Portiforo
knows that Replife is going to live, he will not dare
resort to assassination.”</p>

<p>The woman refused to be comforted by these arguments.
“Who can tell how far that tyrant will dare
to go, now that you have opened his eyes to the fact
that the conspiracy is known?” she asked despairingly.
Then she went below, and Hawley did not see her
again for the rest of the voyage, for she kept to her
stateroom, even having her meals served there. But
the next morning her maid handed him a note, the pathetic
contents of which afforded him much satisfaction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Please forgive me for my unkindness of yesterday.
The sight of that terrible building, so long the
tomb of that poor, noble martyr, made me beside myself.
In my calmer moments I realized that I might<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
have done you an injustice. I believe that you are
brave and generous, and that possibly what you did
you may have thought was for the best. For the
risks that you have run and the sacrifices that you
have made I am not ungrateful; and if, as I cannot
help fearing, terrible consequences to me and mine
have been the result of your gallant if indiscreet attempt,
you have my forgiveness, señor.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Poor little woman,” said the Camera Chap to himself,
as he finished reading this message of forgiveness.
“If only——” His thought was interrupted by a
hand laid on his shoulder. Turning hastily, he looked
into Gale’s grinning countenance.</p>

<p>“A love letter?” the reporter inquired banteringly,
pointing to the note.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” Hawley replied with a laugh, hastily
thrusting the missive into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Seemed to me that it was a lady’s handwriting,”
the <cite>News</cite> man remarked.</p>

<p>The Camera Chap frowned. “How do you know
that?” he demanded indignantly. “Did you dare
look——” Then he abruptly cut himself short, resolved
not to quarrel with the man to whom, he believed,
he partly owed his freedom, and possibly his
life.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help noticing the handwriting as I accidentally
glanced over your shoulder,” Gale explained.</p>

<p>“You didn’t read the letter, did you?” Hawley inquired.
His tone was anxious, for he had not heard
the reporter step up behind him, and, consequently, had
no way of knowing how long he had been there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Gale replied in an aggrieved tone.
“Don’t you give me credit for having any breeding?”</p>

<p>Except for this slightly unpleasant incident, Gale
and the Camera Chap got along well together until the
<em>Eldorado</em> stopped at San Juan, Porto Rico. There the
<cite>News</cite> man made a queer discovery. When the vessel
weighed anchor and started out for her trip to New
York, Hawley was not on board. He had gone ashore,
explaining that he desired to make a purchase, and
had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>When the ship’s officers and the other passengers
learned of this disappearance, they were inclined to believe
that the snapshot man’s failure to show up was
entirely accidental. But Gale, evidently, was not of
that opinion, for, with a malicious smile on his face,
he hurried to the wireless room and sent off a dispatch.
The message was addressed: “Portiforo, National
Palace, San Cristobal,” and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hawley missing at San Juan. Have reason to believe
he is on his way back to Baracoa. Look out
for him.</p>

<p style="margin-top:-0.5em; margin-left:5em"><span class="smcap">“Gale.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>After sending this warning to the sly fox at Baracoa
he felt more cheerful. He had not a desire in the
world to help the president of the little southern republic
in any way; it was entirely his own satisfaction
that was to be furthered by his actions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A WELCOME INTRUSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The day after Hawley’s departure from Baracoa,
Lieutenant Ridder called at the United States legation
with a message from the commander of the <em>Kearsarge</em>
to Minister Throgmorton. On his way out, he encountered
Virginia, and eagerly availed himself of
the opportunity to renew his acquaintance with that
captivating young woman.</p>

<p>The naval officer was flattered by the cordiality
which she displayed toward him, but was astonished
and concerned to observe that when he mentioned the
name of his friend Hawley a frown came to her face
and she hurriedly changed the subject, as though it
were distasteful to her. He went back to his ship
wondering what could have happened to bring about
this change in her sentiments toward the man for
whom she had previously manifested such warm regard.
If Virginia had been asked to explain why she
was displeased with the Camera Chap, she probably
would have found difficulty in stating her grievance
against him. As she had told him, she could not with
logic or justice blame him for going away, knowing
what would happen to him if he ventured to remain
on Baracoan soil. Yet she was disappointed in him,
and his departure had aroused within her a feeling of
resentment.</p>

<p>Possibly it was because he had appeared to accept
the situation with such irritating cheerfulness, or it<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
may have been that she had formed such an exalted
opinion of his heroic qualities that she had half expected—unreasonable
though she knew such expectation
to be—that, at the last moment, he would defy
Portiforo and his order of banishment and not leave
Baracoa without making one more attempt to rescue
the unfortunate prisoner of El Torro.</p>

<p>If Lieutenant Ridder had been a less loyal and unselfish
friend, he might have sought to take advantage
of Virginia’s changed attitude toward the snapshot
man and her evident liking for himself; for the daughter
of the United States envoy had made such a great
impression on him at their first meeting that he
couldn’t help feeling envious of Hawley’s good luck.
Not being at all the kind of fellow to seek to “butt
in” on an absent friend’s romance, however, he made
it a point to steer clear of the embassy, and when, several
days later, a tinted, perfumed note was handed
to him by an orderly on the battleship, a frown came
to his face as he read its contents. The note was
from Miss Throgmorton, and it ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Ridder</span>: I am wondering why I
have not seen you lately. Are they keeping you a
prisoner on the ship? If not, and it is possible for
you to come ashore this afternoon, I should like very
much to have a talk with you.</p>

<p>“I am going for a ride into the country, after
luncheon. If you could find it convenient to meet me,
then come to San Cristobal, and be at the northern
gate of the Botanical Gardens, between one and two
o’clock. You will find an old colored man waiting
there. He will provide you with a mount and conduct<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
you to a place where we can talk without danger of
being spied upon. I hope you won’t think me too unconventional
in writing to you like this, but I positively
must see you on a matter of life and death.”</p>
</div>

<p>At first his almost quixotic sense of fairness caused
him to decide that he would send some excuse for not
keeping this appointment, for he suspected that the
last paragraph of the note must be more or less of
an exaggeration; but presently he reproached himself
for his lack of gallantry. He felt sure that Miss
Throgmorton was too nice a girl to have urged such
an unconventional meeting unless the circumstances
justified it.</p>

<p>Promptly at one o’clock that afternoon, he arrived
at the northern gate of the Botanical Gardens, and
was met by old Uncle Peter, who conducted him to a
near-by stable where two horses, already saddled, were
waiting for them. Half an hour later, as they galloped
along a desolate stretch of dusty road, the navy man
caught sight of a girl on a pony coming toward them,
and his pulses quickened as he recognized the trim,
graceful figure.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are just burning with curiosity as
to why I have sent for you,” Virginia said, with a
smile, as they dismounted.</p>

<p>“Anxiety would be a better word,” he answered.
“The tone of your note was so alarming that it is a
great relief to me to find that you can still smile.”</p>

<p>The girl sighed. “I suppose I have no right to
smile,” she said sadly, “for I really am in great trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded eagerly. “If I can
help, Miss Throgmorton, you know you can count
on me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that I can,” she answered softly.
“That is why I have sent for you. I—but we had
better not talk here. We will go to the top of this
hill. We shall be more safe up there.”</p>

<p>Leaving Uncle Peter in charge of their horses, they
climbed the hillock, and Virginia invited her companion
to seat himself beside her on a bowlder, under
the feathery branches of a bamboo tree. “This is
where—er—Mr. Hawley and I always met when we
had secrets to discuss,” she announced. “It commands
a view of the road in both directions, so there is no
danger of anybody creeping up on us unseen.”</p>

<p>With an excess of caution which made him smile,
she gazed up into the branches of the solitary tree
under which they were sitting. Then she continued,
lowering her voice almost to a whisper: “I am going
to begin, Mr. Ridder, by telling you what picture it
was that Mr. Hawley and I were trying to take at
the fortress the other night.”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary that I should know?” he asked.
He felt somewhat uncomfortable, for he could not
help suspecting that it might be her evident pique
against the Camera Chap which prompted her to give
him the information, which, until now, neither she
nor Hawley had seen fit to confide to him.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Hawley knew what I am doing,” the girl
said, as though reading his thoughts, “I feel sure that
he would approve, for he couldn’t be unreasonable<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
enough to expect that just because he has given up
the task of freeing poor President Felix, nothing else
is to be done.”</p>

<p>“Freeing President Felix?” the naval officer repeated,
looking at her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “It was his picture that we were
trying to get the other night. It was to rescue him
that Mr. Hawley came to Baracoa. And now that he
has gone, and Señora Felix has gone, and they have
done away with poor Doctor Bonsal, there is nobody
left but me to fight for the freedom of that unhappy
man. But I can’t do it alone,” she added wistfully.
“I am only a girl, and I realize my helplessness. I’ve
got to have assistance, and that is why I have decided
to take you into the secret. I know that you are
brave, and generous, and trustworthy, Mr. Ridder.”</p>

<p>The navy man bowed. “I am sure, at least, that you
will find me trustworthy,” he said simply. “If you
really think it best for me to know, I shall be glad to
hear the facts of the case, Miss Throgmorton, and to
give you any help that I can.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Virginia proceeded to tell him the tragic
story of the missing president of Baracoa, and when
she had finished, the lieutenant’s face was very grim.</p>

<p>“It is the most amazing story I ever heard!” he declared.
“It fairly makes my blood boil to think of
that poor fellow being caged up there in the fortress
with a battleship flying the Stars and Stripes less than
half a mile away. But he’s not going to be there much
longer,” he added, a determined expression coming
to his strong face. “You’re quite right, Miss Throgmorton,<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
we’ve got to set him free. If you’ll permit
me, I’ll speak to the captain about it as soon as I get
back to the ship. I’ll tell him the story, and——”</p>

<p>Virginia cut him short with a gesture of disapproval.
“No, you mustn’t do that. What I have told
you is in the strictest confidence. If I thought that any
good would come of it, I would have gone to Captain
Cortrell myself, long before this. But I know that
he would take no action in the matter. You know
how he acted in the case of Mr. Hawley. And if he
couldn’t see his way to do anything for an American
citizen, we can be sure he wouldn’t interfere to help
a man who has no claims on our government.”</p>

<p>“I think you do him an injustice,” her companion
protested, resenting the somewhat bitter tone in which
she spoke of his commanding officer. “There isn’t a
better-hearted or braver officer in the service than our
old man. But, of course, he isn’t always free to do
what he’d like to do. The commanding officer of a
battleship has got to think of pleasing Washington,
D. C., before he can think of pleasing himself. How
about your father, Miss Throgmorton? Surely the
American minister wouldn’t stand for such a conspiracy?”</p>

<p>Virginia sighed. “My father refuses to believe that
there is any such conspiracy,” she said. “Knowing
how favorably disposed father was toward that tyrant
Portiforo, I have always realized the futility of trying
to enlist him in our cause. But yesterday,” she added
with a frown, “it occurred to me that, after all, it was
worth trying. I was desperate, and saw no other way<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
of helping poor President Felix. So I went to my
father and told him my story. He laughed at me and
told me that I was suffering from hallucinations, and
when I insisted, he became very angry and forbade
me ever to mention the subject to him or to anybody
else again.”</p>

<p>A puzzled expression came to the naval officer’s
face. “That’s queer,” he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Ridder,” Virginia continued, “we can’t
hope for any help from either Captain Cortrell or my
father. We’ve got to handle this thing ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But what can we do?”</p>

<p>Virginia looked at him reproachfully. “The other
day, when your friend Mr. Hawley was locked up,
you were ready to go to the jail and attempt a rescue
by force,” she reminded him. “Wouldn’t you do as
much for this unhappy man?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant hesitated. “If I were sure that such
an attempt would be successful, I wouldn’t mind tackling
it,” he said. “But if I were to fail, Miss Throgmorton,
you must realize what it would mean.
There’d be the deuce to pay in Washington, and——”</p>

<p>“You didn’t think of that when Mr. Hawley was in
danger,” Virginia protested indignantly. “You were
quite ready to risk your career in the navy, and possibly
your life, then.”</p>

<p>“But Hawley was my friend, and I was under great
obligations to him, besides.”</p>

<p>“Does that make such a great difference?” the girl
inquired somewhat coldly. “Are you willing to remain<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
inactive while an innocent man is suffering a
fate worse than death? Do you not feel an obligation
to expose the villainy of these rascals? If so, I must
say that I am disappointed in you, Mr. Ridder.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds the lieutenant remained silent.
Then suddenly his face lighted up. “You are right,
Miss Throgmorton,” he said, “I can’t leave Baracoa
without making an attempt to set Felix free. I don’t
know how we’ll go about it, but we’ll find a way—you
and I together.” He jumped to his feet, and,
shading his eyes with his hand, looked toward the point
in the road where Uncle Peter was waiting with the
horses.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed. “Who’s that talking with
your colored man? Looks like a tramp.”</p>

<p>“More likely a spy,” Virginia remarked, frowning.
“I quite expected that I would be followed. Well,
of all the audacity! Look! He’s actually coming up
to us.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the stranger, having exchanged a few
words with the old darky, was climbing up the hill
toward them, walking with the shambling gait of a
native mendicant. He was a dark-haired, swarthy
man, apparently past middle age. He was tall, but his
figure was so bent that he appeared to be undersized.
There was a five days’ growth of hair on his chin,
his clothing was in rags, and his feet were bare. Altogether,
he was by no means a prepossessing person.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, señor, for this intrusion,” he
whined, addressing Ridder in Spanish, “but if you
would earn the undying gratitude of a starving wretch,<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
you can do so by separating yourself from a few cents.
American money will do.”</p>

<p>“Go away,” the navy man growled. He spoke
with unwonted roughness, which was due in part to
Virginia’s suspicion that the intruder was probably a
spy, and partly to the fact that although the lieutenant’s
knowledge of Spanish was limited, he was sufficiently
familiar with that language to realize the insolence
with which the beggar spoke. “<i lang="es">Onda pronto!</i>” he exclaimed,
with a threatening gesture.</p>

<p>He was startled by a cry from Virginia—a cry of
mingled astonishment and joy. “Mr. Hawley!” the
girl exclaimed with a half-hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>“Hawley!” Ridder exclaimed staring incredulously
at the human scarecrow. “Well, I’ll be hanged
if it isn’t!”</p>

<p>For a few seconds the ragged mendicant appeared
bewildered. He stared blankly at the couple. Then
suddenly a broad grin appeared on his swarthy countenance.
“This is a bitter disappointment,” he declared
ruefully. “I had been hoping that this get-up
of mine was good enough to deceive even your sharp
eyes, Miss Throgmorton.”</p>

</div>


<p>“So you have come back!” said Virginia, her face
radiant, a thrill of admiration in her voice.</p>

<p>“Of course,” the Camera Chap said simply. “Did
you think that I wouldn’t? Surely you didn’t think
me capable of being such a wretched quitter?”</p>

<p>The girl’s face showed her remorse. “Forgive me,”
she said. “Of course, I ought to have known that even
so great a risk couldn’t keep you away. But you really
should not have done it,” she protested, with a contrariness
which amused Ridder. “You are taking your
life in your hands. If any of Portiforo’s spies should
recognize you——”</p>

<p>“I am in hopes that the eyes of Portiforo’s spies
won’t be as sharp as yours,” said the president’s
photographic envoy, shrugging his shoulders. “It
seems to me that this disguise is pretty good.”</p>

<p>“It is splendid!” Virginia declared. “And your
mannerisms, too. I had no idea that you were such an
accomplished actor. I can’t explain how I knew it was
you—certainly there was nothing about you to give you
away. I guess it must have been my instinct which
told me,” she added, with a blush.</p>

<p>“I must admit you had me completely fooled, old
man,” declared Ridder, with a grin. “It’s a wonderful
make-up.” He looked his friend over from head
to foot and laughed. “Ye gods, you certainly are
some spectacle!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>Hawley’s face reflected his grin. “Talking about
spectacles,” he said, “how’s our friend, Captain Reyes?
Can either of you tell me whether he’s still wearing
those blue goggles?”</p>

<p>“He was wearing them as late as this morning,”
Virginia informed him, with a gleam of comprehension
of the Camera Chap’s apparently irrelevant interest
in the eyesight of the custodian of President
Felix. “I met him to-day on the Avenida Juarez, and
he told me that his eyes were giving him a lot of trouble,
but are greatly improved since he has worn the
glasses. The specialist has ordered him to wear them
both night and day.”</p>

<p>“Night and day!” the snapshot adventurer echoed
joyously. “That’s better than I dared hope for. Of
course, I ought to be ashamed of myself for gloating
over another man’s misfortune, but I can’t help regarding
this as a gift from the gods. But tell me,” he
added, a shade of anxiety flitting across his face, “is
Reyes still at the fortress, or have they put him on the
sick list?”</p>

<p>“He is still on duty,” Virginia announced. “I asked
him, this morning, why he didn’t lay off until his eyes
were better, and he told me that his superiors had
urged him to do so, but that he had insisted that he
was capable of attending to his duties, and that they
had let him have his way in the matter.”</p>

<p>Hawley exhaled a deep breath of relief. “Now I
know that we’re going to win out,” he chuckled. “Fortune
wouldn’t have put so many things our way if she
weren’t on our side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>“But what do you expect to gain by those blue
spectacles?” Lieutenant Ridder demanded. “I can’t
see how they’re going to help us free Felix.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap gave a start of surprise, and
turned, with an inquiring glance, to Virginia.</p>

<p>“I—I felt that I had to tell him,” the latter stammered
contritely. “I thought—I didn’t know that you
were coming back, and it was necessary to have somebody
to help me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Miss Throgmorton,” Hawley assured
her. “I’m glad Ridder’s been initiated into the
order. If you hadn’t told him, I should have done so
myself. For in order to put through the little scheme
I have in mind, old man,” he announced, addressing
the lieutenant, “I shall need your help.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do whatever I can,” Ridder replied.
“The story which Miss Throgmorton has told
me about Felix has got me so agitated that I’m ready
to go the limit in order to help free him.”</p>

<p>“What I want you to do,” said Hawley, “is to make
arrangements for a dinner to be held on board the
<em>Kearsarge</em>.”</p>

<p>“A dinner?”</p>

<p>“A banquet to be given by the officers of the visiting
battleship to the officers of the fortress,” the snapshot
adventurer explained. “I believe such affairs are
not unusual?”</p>

<p>“Generally it is the other way around—the other
fellows wine and dine us first, and then we return the
compliment,” the navy man said. “However, I guess<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
I won’t have any difficulty in persuading the captain
to reverse the usual order of things in this case. But
what’s the idea? Is this dinner part of your scheme
for rescuing Felix?”</p>

<p>“A very important part of it,” the Camera Chap informed
him. “If you can bring it about and manage
to have our friend of the blue glasses among those
present, I have every hope of success. I’ll outline the
idea to you. I am confident that you’ll both be as enthusiastic
over it as I am.”</p>

<p>But, greatly to his surprise, when he told them
what he had in mind, they failed to display the amount
of enthusiasm which he had expected.</p>

<p>“It would be sheer madness for you to attempt such
a desperate thing,” was Virginia’s verdict. “You
would surely be caught. Anxious as I am to see President
Felix set free, I must beg you to give up all
thought of carrying out this plan, Mr. Hawley.”</p>

<p>“It’s a clever scheme,” declared Ridder. “I take
off my hat to you, old man, for your ingenuity in
having thought of it, and your grit in being willing to
put it through; but I agree with Miss Throgmorton
that it is much too risky a proposition. You might
stand a slim chance of getting the picture, but you’d
stand a much greater chance of being backed up against
an adobe wall with a firing squad using you for target
practice. Besides, it isn’t fair that you should do
the whole thing all by yourself. Now that you’ve
taken me into the secret, we ought to divide up the
work and the danger.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap smiled. “There’ll be work and<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
danger enough for you, too,” he promised. “If I’m
caught and it comes out that you were mixed up in
the plot—and I’m afraid that’s bound to come out—I
can see a peck of trouble coming your way. Portiforo
will probably demand your surrender as accessory,
and even if your skipper refuses to give you up,
there’ll probably be a court-martial in Washington in
store for you, and possibly dismissal from the service.
All this, of course, is to be dreaded only in the event
of failure. But I’m not going to fail. I disagree with
you both about my scheme not being practical. Of
course, if we had to go up against a well-organized,
highly disciplined garrison, I’d have to admit that
our chances of success were scant. But Portiforo’s
army is a joke. Those soldiers at the fortress remind
me of a lot of supes in a comic-opera chorus. With
a crowd like that to deal with, it would be possible to
get away with almost anything. If Felix is still in
the same cell—if they haven’t moved him—it’s going
to be mere child’s play to get the snapshot and make
my escape—much easier than our other attempt, Miss
Throgmorton.”</p>

<p>“But if they have moved him?” Virginia suggested
fearfully. “And it is very likely that they have. It is
only reasonable to suppose that after our last attempt,
those scoundrels would have taken that precaution. If
they have him locked up in another dungeon—one that
cannot be reached from the outside—what are you
going to do then?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “In that event,” he replied
carelessly, “my job is going to be a little more<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
difficult, of course. I shall have to go inside the
fortress and hunt around until I find him. But let’s be
optimistic.”</p>

<p>Although they still demurred at the project, they
failed to dampen his ardor or persuade him to give
it up.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">LIKE A BAD PENNY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Virginia returned to the embassy, an unpleasant
surprise awaited her in the form of a good-looking,
dapper young man who greeted her with a sardonic
grin.</p>

<p>“Hardly expected to see me back again, I suppose?”
he remarked quizzically.</p>

<p>“I certainly did not,” the girl replied coldly. “I
supposed that you were in New York by this time,
Mr. Gale.”</p>

<p>“I changed my mind just after the boat sailed out
of San Juan harbor, and went ashore in the pilot
boat,” the reporter informed her. “There were certain
reasons why I deemed it advisable to return to
Baracoa, so I cabled the office that they’d have to
struggle along without me for a little while longer,
and caught the next boat back to Puerto Cabero.” He
chuckled. “I rather thought you’d be astonished to
see me, Virginia. Almost as astonished, I’ll wager,
as you were to see our friend Hawley come back
again.”</p>

<p>The girl gave an involuntary start of surprise, and
her face paled. “Then you——” she began, but caught
herself quickly. “Mr. Hawley back again!” she exclaimed,
with an air of incredulity which was well
simulated. “Surely that can’t be possible!”</p>

<p>Gale smiled triumphantly. The sentence which she<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
had left uncompleted and her momentary agitation had
not escaped his notice. “Yes, he’s back,” he said, with
sarcasm. “Didn’t you know that? I had an idea
that you might have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Surely you wouldn’t expect him to show his face in
San Cristobal, considering the circumstances under
which he left,” the girl returned, her blue eyes boldly
meeting his searching gaze.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” Gale rejoined, after a slight pause,
during which he did some rapid thinking. “Perhaps I
was wrong in assuming that he has returned to Baracoa
at all. He disappeared from the ship at San Juan,
and I had an idea that he might have come back
here.”</p>

<p>“Is that why you returned, too?” Virginia demanded
scornfully. “Were you lured back by the hope of
finding him in Portiforo’s clutches again, and being
able to gloat over his fate?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” the reporter answered emphatically.
“I’m not bothering about Hawley at all. I came back
here on a matter of business.”</p>

<p>Part of his statement was the truth. It was not
merely malice which had caused the man to postpone
his return to New York and hurry back to San Cristobal
as soon as he had discovered that Hawley was
missing from the steamer. He had a professional
reason for taking this step. He decided that he might
have acted somewhat rashly in notifying his office that
there was nothing in the weird rumors concerning
Felix’s incarceration in El Torro fortress. A certain<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
note which the wife of the missing president of Baracoa
had written to the Camera Chap, part of which
he had managed to read over the latter’s shoulder, on
the promenade deck of the steamship, had opened the
reporter’s eyes to the possibility that he might have
made a big mistake. He concluded that he had better
seek to rectify that mistake by returning to Baracoa
and making another attempt to get at the facts concerning
Felix.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to find that you took me seriously the
other day when we had that talk concerning Hawley,”
he said to Virginia. “I don’t really wish the fellow
any harm. He and I are good friends, now—I suppose
he’s told you of the large part I had in getting him
set free—and I should regret exceedingly seeing him
in trouble again. I am glad to learn that he hasn’t
shown up in San Cristobal. I was afraid that he might
have shipped from San Juan in a tramp steamer headed
this way. But, as you say, it is scarcely likely that he
would have done such a rash thing.”</p>

<p>He spoke without the slightest tinge of irony in his
tone. It had suddenly occurred to him that it would
be a good idea to give his host’s daughter the impression
this his suspicions were lulled. More was to
be gained, he decided, by watching her closely for the
next few days than by endeavoring to bluff her into an
admission that she knew of the Camera Chap’s return
to Baracoa and the reason thereof. That Hawley had
returned to Baracoa he now felt quite sure. Virginia’s
demeanor had confirmed what, until then, had
been merely a suspicion on his part. And that the<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
snapshot adventurer’s motive in coming back was to
have another try at getting Felix’s picture, Gale was
equally certain. For the next three days he proceeded
to carry out his plan of keeping a close watch on his
host’s daughter. He felt sure that sooner or later
she would communicate in some way with the Camera
Chap. Probably they were hatching out some scheme
together for landing the precious snapshot. If so, by
watching the fruition of that scheme, he hoped at least
to gain some valuable information as to the whereabouts
of Felix. Perhaps, even, if he played his cards
right, he might be able to force Hawley to share the
picture with him, in the event of the latter’s success.
A still more alluring prospect was the possibility of
letting that expert snapshotter get the picture, and
then, by working some clever trick, getting it away
from him so that he could hand to his paper one of
the greatest photographic scoops which had ever startled
Park Row. Difficult as he realized this last feat
would be, the <cite>News</cite> man did not consider it impossible
of fulfillment.</p>

<p>He subjected Virginia to an espionage which would
have done credit to one of Portiforo’s professional
spies, shrewdly suspecting that she was the keystone
to the whole situation. But if the girl was in communication
with the Camera Chap she was managing
it with a skill and cautiousness which outclassed his
keen powers of observation; for he was unable to detect
even any indication that she had knowledge of
Hawley’s whereabouts. One discovery he did make,
though: she seemed to have grown very friendly with a<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
certain good-looking, husky young officer of the battleship
<em>Kearsarge</em>. Gale learned that this man’s name was
Ridder. He and Virginia met frequently and with a
secretiveness which made the reporter wonder whether
the daughter of his host hadn’t already forgotten all
about Hawley and was going through the early stages
of a new romance. Strange to say, it did not occur to
Gale that the naval officer might be acting as an intermediary
between Virginia and the exiled snapshotter.
He began to feel less positive that the latter had
returned to Baracoa. At all events, he was pretty sure
that the Camera Chap hadn’t ventured to show his
face in the capital or its environs, for he had reason to
believe that Portiforo’s spies were keeping a sharp
lookout for that unwelcome visitor, and if he had been
there it was scarcely likely that those human ferrets
wouldn’t have unearthed him by this time.</p>

<p>Having come to this conclusion, the reporter gradually
ceased his close watch of Virginia’s movements,
and spent most of his time in Puerto Cabero, cultivating
the acquaintance of the soldiers of the fortress,
particularly that of Captain Ernesto Reyes. He managed
to persuade the latter to take him on another tour
of inspection through the prison of El Torro, but was
unable to find any trace of Felix there.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat drinking with Reyes in a café
much frequented by officers of the army, the captain
asked him whether he had received an invitation to the
banquet on the warship.</p>

<p>“What banquet is that?” Gale inquired curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>Captain Reyes produced a card on which was engraved
a formal invitation requesting his presence at
a dinner to be tendered by the officers of the <em>Kearsarge</em>
to the officers of El Torro garrison.</p>

<p>“I supposed that surely you would receive an invitation,
Señor Gale,” the army officer remarked.
“The American minister and Miss Throgmorton are
going to be there, so it is queer that you should have
been overlooked.”</p>

<p>“Maybe mine will arrive later,” the reporter said.
“Are you going to attend?”</p>

<p>The other announced that he expected to be among
those present. “I was going to send my regrets at
first, on account of my eyesight,” he declared. “I was
afraid that with these glasses I should not be exactly
an ornament at the festive board, and in such a well-lighted
room I would not dare to leave them off. But
Miss Throgmorton insisted upon my accepting the invitation.”</p>

<p>“Miss Throgmorton?” There was an inflection of
surprise in Gale’s tone.</p>

<p>The gallant captain smiled complacently. “She told
me that it would spoil the whole evening for her if I
were not present. So what could I do, my friend? Of
course, as a gentleman and a soldier, I could not disappoint
a lady—especially one so charming as the
daughter of the American minister.”</p>

<p>Gale looked thoughtfully at his wine. “I wonder
why she should be so anxious to have you there,” he
muttered. “It strikes me as being deucedly queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>His companion’s manner showed that he resented
the remark. “I see nothing so very queer about it,”
he said indignantly. “I do not wish to appear boastful.
Otherwise, perhaps, it would not be difficult for me
to explain why Miss Throgmorton finds such evident
pleasure in my society.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">CAUSE FOR ANXIETY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Gale returned to the embassy he found an invitation
to the dinner awaiting him. Minister Throgmorton
had mentioned to Captain Cortrell that he had
a guest stopping at his home, and the commander of
the warship had been prompt to take the hint. The
reporter accepted the invitation with alacrity. As a
rule, he was not fond of formal dinners. In the
course of his reportorial experience he had attended
many of them in an official capacity, and he had come
to regard such functions as decidedly boresome. The
solid and liquid refreshments were, in his opinion, but
poor compensation for the ordeal of having to listen to
the long-winded, dry speeches which always came
afterward. But he expected to find much to interest
him at this dinner on the battleship. What his friend
Captain Reyes had told him made him so eager to attend
that even if he had not received an invitation
he had fully decided that he was going to find some
way of being present.</p>

<p>Virginia’s behavior increased his suspicion that there
was a peculiar significance attached to the affair. The
girl appeared strangely anxious and ill at ease. If she
had been a débutante looking forward to her first formal
party, she could scarcely have evinced more nervousness
and considering that, because of her father’s
position, such festivities were common occurrences in<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
her life, her state of mind struck the observant newspaper
man as being somewhat remarkable.</p>

<p>A conversation which he overheard between the girl
and Lieutenant Ridder a day before the event enlightened
him to some extent as to the cause of Virginia’s
anxiety. The naval officer had called at the
legation, and, on his way out through the garden, he
stopped to exchange a few words with her.</p>

<p>“Everything is coming along fine,” he informed her,
unaware, of course, that the <cite>News</cite> man, concealed
behind some shrubbery, was listening with intense
eagerness. “The more I think about the scheme, the
more I begin to believe that it is going to work out
all right.”</p>

<p>“But suppose Reyes should, at the last minute,
change his mind and fail to show up?” Virginia suggested
timorously. “That would spoil everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that would spoil everything—for the time
being,” Ridder agreed. “We should have to postpone
the attempt. But why should we suppose anything
so gloomy, my dear Miss Throgmorton? He has accepted
the invitation, and he has assured you that he
will be there.” A smile lighted up his face. “If you
want to make absolutely sure that he won’t disappoint
us, why don’t you ask him to call for you and escort
you to the dinner? If he has any blood in his veins, he
would jump at such an opportunity, and once he’s
made the engagement he couldn’t be so unchivalrous
as to back out.”</p>

<p>Virginia received this suggestion with an ejaculation
of delight. “If he escorted me to the dinner, it<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
would be his duty, of course, to see me home, also,”
she murmured, talking more to herself than to her companion.
“That is a splendid idea of yours, Mr. Ridder—probably
even a better one than you supposed.
It has given me a big inspiration. I see a way, now,
to change our original plans so as to reduce the danger
of accidents to a minimum.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” the naval officer demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>To the eavesdropper’s keen disappointment, the
pair walked away from that spot before the girl answered,
so he was unable to learn the nature of the
inspiration which had come to her. However, incomplete
and puzzling though it was, he felt that he had
good cause to congratulate himself on the information
he had already gleaned.</p>

<p>The next morning, Virginia sent a charmingly
worded note to Captain Reyes, and, as Ridder had expected,
the Baracoan was much flattered by this fresh
proof of Miss Throgmorton’s favor, and eagerly
grabbed at the opportunity which her note offered
him to be her companion on the trip from the capital
to the warship.</p>

<p>Moreover, he triumphantly exhibited the note to his
friend Gale, later that day, as a proof of his intimacy
with the fair daughter of the United States envoy.</p>

<p>The reporter smiled sardonically as he read the
dainty missive. “Doesn’t it strike you as the least bit
odd, my dear Ernesto, that Miss Throgmorton should
put you to the trouble of coming all the way from the
fortress to the embassy to call for her when she has<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
both her father and myself to escort her?” he suggested.</p>

<p>Reyes laughed quizzically. “Ah, my unfortunate
friend, I cannot blame you for being jealous!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Gale shrugged his shoulders, but let the taunt pass
without verbal comment. He had suddenly changed
his mind as to the advisability of striving to make the
army officer see the matter from his viewpoint. The
thought had come to him that, after all, it would be
better not to interfere with Virginia’s mysterious plans
at the present stage of the game. It would be time
enough to open Reyes’ eyes when the situation had
taken more definite shape.</p>

<p>Resplendent in gold lace and gilt buttons, the Baracoan
called at the embassy that evening, so late that he
found Virginia on the verge of tears. Her father and
Gale had left for the battleship nearly an hour earlier,
and ever since then she had been almost frantic with
impatience and fear that her escort was not going to
show up at all. She received his apologies graciously,
however, as they motored swiftly down the steep roads
which led to Puerto Cabero. Not for all the world
would he have been guilty of such a sad breach of
decorum, her penitent companion assured her, if it
had not been absolutely unavoidable. His duties at the
fortress had made it impossible for him to get away
earlier.</p>

<p>“In fact, my dear señorita,” he announced, “if I
had not made this engagement with you—which, of
course, could not be broken under any circumstances—I<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
fear I should have had to disappoint our hosts this
evening and remain on duty at the fortress. On account
of our latest advices regarding the enemy, our
commanding officer did not deem it advisable that so
many of his staff should absent themselves from the
fortress at one time. Half of us were asked at the
last minute to send our regrets to the <em>Kearsarge</em> and
remain on duty, and, at first, I was among those selected
to stay behind; but when I had explained to the
general about my appointment with you, he agreed
with me that I must go.”</p>

<p>“Then I am very glad that I asked you to be my
escort,” Virginia declared with a fervor which went
to his head like a strong wine. “But what do you mean
by advices regarding the enemy? To what enemy do
you refer?” she inquired nervously.</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment. “To the revolutionists,
of course, señorita. That traitor Rodriguez
and his band of ruffians have proven somewhat
stronger than we had imagined. To-day they overcame
a detachment of Federal troops at Santa Barbara
and seized the railroad. It is believed that, emboldened
by their success, the beggars are now contemplating
a forced march on the capital.”</p>

<p>“But surely you do not fear an attack upon the
fortress to-night?” Virginia inquired, her voice tense
with anxiety.</p>

<p>Her companion laughed contemptuously. “Certainly
not. There is no occasion for alarm, señorita.
Those fellows will never get within a hundred miles
of the capital. When they get up against Villaria’s<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
brigade they will be annihilated. Still, it would be bad
generalship not to be prepared. I believe you have
a saying in your language about eternal vigilance being
the guarantee of safety. That is why our garrison
has been placed on a strictly war basis and half of our
staff has found it impossible to be the guests of the
American officers this evening.”</p>

<p>What he had said caused Virginia to feel uneasy,
but she made a valiant attempt to conceal her state of
mind from him. “I am glad to hear that the fortress
is in no danger—from the insurrectos,” she said, and
her escort was astonished at the emphasis with which
she spoke.</p>

<p>He favored her with a searching glance from behind
his blue spectacles. From her past actions, he had
good reason to believe that she was in sympathy with
the enemies of the Portiforo administration. He did
not feel any great bitterness toward her on that account.
The fact that she was a woman, and a very
pretty one, made him inclined to view her past offenses
with indulgence. But it chafed him to hear her now
expressing views, which, he was compelled to believe,
could not be sincere.</p>

<p>“You do not desire the revolutionary cause to triumph,
señorita?” he inquired, a strain of irony in his
tone.</p>

<p>Virginia shrugged her shoulders. “To be quite
frank with you, I don’t care whether they triumph or
not. It is all the same to me which side wins,” she
replied carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[269]</span></p>

<p>“Then why are you so glad that the fortress is in
no danger of attack?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she answered serenely, “if the insurrectos
were to be so inconsiderate as to attack El Torro
to-night, I fear it would interfere with our dinner.”</p>

<p>Reyes laughed heartily. “Oh, is that the reason?
Well, have no fear, my dear Señorita Throgmorton.
I assure you that there is not the slightest danger of
our appetites being spoiled by any such interruption.”</p>

<p>A little later they arrived at the seaport, and, alighting
from the car, entered one of the battleship’s
launches which was waiting at the landing for them.
As they stepped to the deck of the <em>Kearsarge</em>, Lieutenant
Ridder greeted them. That young officer’s
face, which, a minute before, had worn a strained,
worried expression, was now illuminated by a broad
smile. “I’m glad to see you,” he said to the girl. “I
was beginning to be afraid that you weren’t coming.”</p>

<p>She smiled in a manner which showed that she appreciated
the fact that, while to others his words might
have sounded like a compliment, they were intended to
be congratulatory. But a second later the smile disappeared
from her lips. She glanced furtively at
Reyes, and saw that he was occupied at the moment,
chatting with one of the ship’s officers, and she eagerly
availed herself of this opportunity for a few confidential
words with Ridder.</p>

<p>“There is danger,” she whispered. “I am afraid we
must give up the idea. I have just learned that they
are very much on their guard at the fortress. They
are awaiting a possible attack of the revolutionists,<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
and the whole garrison is unusually wide awake.
Under the circumstances it would be madness to go
ahead to-night. Tell Mr. Hawley——”</p>

<p>The naval officer interrupted her with a deprecatory
gesture. “It is no use,” he whispered. “I have already
told him. I knew about the danger. Half our
guests have sent their regrets, and some of those who
are here have told us the reason. I have been trying
my hardest to persuade Hawley that, under the circumstances,
he couldn’t possibly get away with his
scheme to-night, but the plucky old chap won’t listen.
He says that we’ve made our plans, and it’s too late
to change them now. He insists upon going through
with it.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">AN INTERRUPTED DINNER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The guests of the <em>Kearsarge</em> had no cause to complain
of the measure of Uncle Sam’s hospitality. If
the scene of the banquet had been a first-class hotel,
the preparations could scarcely have been more elaborate.
The big battleship presented a spectacle of dazzling
splendor. From bow to stern, masthead to lower
deck, her grim lines had been beautified by a blaze of
electric lights, flags, Japanese lanterns, bunting, and
flowers. The wardroom being too small to accommodate
the big dinner party, the spacious upper deck
had been converted into an open-air dining room. At
tables set together so as to form a huge horseshoe,
covered with fine linen and laden with massive silver,
the guests were served with a feast of rare daintiness.</p>

<p>There were several women present at the banquet,
for the officers of the garrison had been invited to
bring their wives, sweethearts, sisters, and daughters.
Gale had discovered that the girl next to him was the
niece of the commandant of the fortress, and he exerted
himself to be agreeable to her, not only because
she was a young woman of fascinating personality,
but because, always having an eye for the main chance,
he foresaw that her relationship to the man in charge
of El Torro garrison might come in useful to him
later on.</p>

<p>Although he kept up a sprightly conversation with<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
her and appeared to give her his entire attention, he
was all the time keeping a close watch on Virginia and
Captain Reyes. That interesting pair, as luck would
have it, sat almost directly opposite to him, and he
was able to observe every move they made.</p>

<p>Just as the last course of the dinner had been
served and the speeches were about to begin, Gale saw
the daughter of the American minister lean back in
the chair and half close her eyes, while a look of distress
came to her pretty face.</p>

<p>This action was not lost upon Captain Reyes. He
bent toward her solicitously. “What is the matter,
señorita?” he inquired. “Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it will pass away soon,” the girl answered,
apparently making a brave effort to pull herself together.
But she seemed to grow worse instead of
better, for presently she whispered, in response to an
anxious inquiry from the captain: “If my father
were not down on the program for a speech I think
I should ask him to take me home.”</p>

<p>“There is no need to bother your father, señorita,”
Reyes said promptly. “If you wish to go home, I am
at your service.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” Virginia said faintly, flashing
him a grateful smile; “but, of course, I could not
dream of taking you away. I must try to wait until
my father has finished his speech. I wish he was first
on the list, but I am afraid——”</p>

<p>“I shan’t mind it at all,” her escort cut in eagerly.
“In fact, I shall be delighted to accompany you.” And
his eagerness was not feigned, for he was glad to exchange<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
the terrors of the postprandial oratory for the
pleasure of a boat ride and automobile jaunt with this
pretty girl.</p>

<p>“Well, if you insist,” said the latter, “let us try to
leave as unobtrusively as possible. I think the trip
home will do me good.”</p>

<p>They left the table so quietly that few noticed their
departure; but a few minutes later, as they were stepping
toward the port gangway, Reyes became aware
of a hand placed on his shoulder, and, turning, learned
that Gale had followed them out.</p>

<p>“A word with you,” the reporter whispered. “It is
of the utmost importance.”</p>

<p>The frown which came to the other’s face showed
that he resented this intrusion, but something in Gale’s
manner caused him to draw back and allow Virginia
to go on alone.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded sharply. “I must say,
señor, that I am beginning to grow very weary of
this confounded interference——”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” the <cite>News</cite> man cut him
short. “Tell me quickly: Has she fooled you into
going away with her?”</p>

<p>“Fooled me!” The Baracoan’s frown deepened
into a scowl. “I do not understand,” he said haughtily.
“Miss Throgmorton is feeling indisposed and I am
taking her home.”</p>

<p>To his astonishment and indignation, Gale received
this with an ironical laugh. “I guess it is about time
to open your eyes,” he said. “I am wise now to the
whole game.” He whispered a few words in the<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
army officer’s ear. What he said caused the latter to
give a start of surprise.</p>

<p>“This is astounding!” Reyes muttered. “Are you
sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am not sure,” the reporter replied.
“But you’ll see that I am right.”</p>

<p>Virginia, noting her escort’s absence from her side,
turned at the head of the gangway, and a worried look
came to her face as she saw with whom he was talking.</p>

<p>“The launch is waiting for us, Captain Reyes,” she
called out impatiently. “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>The Baracoan hesitated a moment. Then, with
sudden decision, he whispered a few words to Gale,
stepped to the girl’s side, and assisted her down the
ladder. As they got into the boat, Gale followed
them. “Guess I’m going ashore, too,” the reporter
said, with a grin. “I have some business which needs
my immediate attention.”</p>

<p>Virginia glanced at her escort’s face. She observed
with concern that he did not seem to resent this intrusion.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">A BOLD ATTEMPT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>About fifteen minutes after the gray steam launch
containing Virginia, Reyes, and Gale had left the battleship,
another of the <em>Kearsarge’s</em> hooded fifty-footers
darted away from the starboard gangway apparently,
from the course she took, bound for the landing at
Puerto Cabero. But after this little craft had gone
far enough away to be out of sight of the battleship,
it suddenly changed its course, and, making a wide
detour, sped toward the fortress of El Torro.</p>

<p>Presently the lone sentry, pacing the narrow strip
of land in front of that ugly gray building, brought
his rifle smartly down from his shoulder as the boat
reached the beach and a tall figure stepped ashore.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?” the picket demanded.
But without waiting for an answer he abandoned his
menacing attitude and respectfully presented arms.
For, although it was dark, he was able to discern that
the man who had stepped ashore from the battleship’s
launch wore the uniform of a captain of the army of
Baracoa, and that his eyes were screened by a pair
of familiar blue spectacles. The newcomer stiffly acknowledged
the salute, then turned to shake hands
with the natty young American naval officer in charge
of the launch’s crew. “Well, good-by, Captain Reyes,”
the sentry heard the naval officer say, addressing the
bespectacled man in Spanish. “Sorry that you are<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
obliged to leave us before the fun is all over. I trust
we shall meet again soon.”</p>

<p>The launch started back toward the battleship, whose
gayly illuminated outline the sentry had been gazing
at wistfully all night, wishing that he wore epaulets
so that he, too, might be wining and dining instead of
doing wearisome picket duty; but after the little boat
had gone a short way it stopped, as though something
might be the matter with its machinery.</p>

<p>The sentry might have paid more attention to this
maneuver if the bespectacled man in the captain’s uniform
had not at that moment addressed him.</p>

<p>“You can go,” the latter announced. “You are
relieved. I will take your place.”</p>

<p>The words, which were in Spanish, were spoken
with a thickness which, in the picket’s opinion, seemed
to account for the unusualness of the incident. He
observed, too, that the other swayed as he spoke. By
which token he deduced that the supply of champagne
aboard the battleship had been plentiful.</p>

<p>As the sentry hesitated, the man with the epaulets
turned upon him fiercely. “What are you waiting
for?” he demanded. “Do you not understand? You
are relieved.” His utterance had grown even thicker
than before, and his voice did not sound much like
that of Captain Reyes, but, considering his condition,
the soldier saw nothing strange about that. Promptly
the latter once more presented arms. Tipsy or sober,
the man in the blue spectacles was his superior officer,
and it was not for a common soldier to question his
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[277]</span></p>

<p>Watching this scene from the launch, Lieutenant
Ridder exhaled a deep breath of relief as he saw the
sentry walk away and disappear within the fortress.
“He got away with it, all right,” he muttered joyously.
“But,” he added grimly, “the worst is yet to come.”</p>

<p>The next five minutes were the most anxious ones
that Ridder had ever passed through in all his life.
As he sat, with his hands gripping the wheel of the
launch, straining his eyes in an effort to see what was
going on ashore, his teeth were clenched and his heart
was pounding against his ribs.</p>

<p>The man in the blue spectacles had disappeared behind
a row of tall bushes in front of the fortress.
Presently—it seemed like ages to the anxious naval
officer—there came from behind this foliage a flash
of light and a dull boom like an explosion of wet
powder.</p>

<p>Ridder gave vent to an ejaculation of joy. “By
Jove, he’s done it!” he muttered. “Good old Hawley!”
As he saw a slim figure dart out from behind the
bushes and approach the water’s edge, he gave the
wheel in his hand a swift turn and sent the launch
dashing toward the beach.</p>

<p>But short as was the distance the boat had to cover
to reach his comrade, he was too late. Led by a stout
man in civilian garb, a swarm of soldiers had rushed
out of the fortress and seized the Camera Chap just
as the latter, perceiving that the launch would not get
to him in time, was about to throw himself into the
water.</p>

<p>“What have we here?” exclaimed the corpulent person<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
in civilian garb, savagely tearing the blue spectacles
from the prisoner’s face. Then, as he recognized
Hawley, he uttered an exclamation of mingled
astonishment and joy.</p>

<p>“Ah, I perceive it is our brave and ingenious Yankee
snapshotter!” he sneered. “So you have come back
to Baracoa, señor! Permit me to compliment you
upon the brilliancy of your latest exploit, and to condole
with you that such a brave and clever attempt
should have met with such poor success. We——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for at that moment
Lieutenant Ridder with the three sailors of the launch
at his heels, rushed up to the group.</p>

<p>“Let this man go!” the naval officer bellowed, brandishing
a revolver. “He’s an American citizen, and
you daren’t touch him.”</p>

<p>The fat man laughed ironically. “You appear to
have an extremely vague idea of international law, my
impetuous friend,” he remarked; “surprisingly vague,
in view of the uniform you wear. I should advise you,
señor, to go back to your ship, and to congratulate
yourself that you, too, are not placed under arrest.
Unless you depart immediately, the consequences are
liable to be serious for both yourself and your country.”</p>

<p>“For my country!” Ridder began derisively. “Why,
you chump——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, there, old man!” Hawley broke in, smiling
at his friend’s recklessness. “You’d better do as he
says, and go back to the ship. You can’t do any good,
and, if you attempt to interfere, you may indeed cause<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
international complications. Especially,” he added,
with a chuckle, “if you are guilty of such a grave
breach of decorum as to call his excellency, the President
of Baracoa, a chump.”</p>

<p>Ridder gave a start of surprise. Until that moment,
the identity of the stout man in civilian attire
had not been known to him. With the instinctive respect
which his training as a naval officer caused him
to feel for the head of a sister republic, no matter
what he might think of the man personally, for a moment
he was abashed at what he had done. But a second
later he was guilty of a still greater breach of
decorum.</p>

<p>Stepping up to Portiforo, before anybody could
realize what he was about to do, he pressed the muzzle
of his revolver against that startled dignitary’s “corporation.”
“So this is the president!” he cried, with a
triumphant laugh. “Well, so much the better! We
may be outnumbered, but I guess we hold the trump
card. Get into the boat, Frank, old man, and beat
it back to the ship. These fellows can’t stop you.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dare!” the president gasped, his
bloated face turning pale. “Do you realize, señor, that
this is the greatest outrage in all history?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ridder, of the United States navy, did
realize that. He was aware that his mad act was
likely to “raise the deuce at Washington,” cause a
howl of protest to go up from every nation on the
globe, and possibly bring on an international trouble.
He had every reason to believe, too, that even if he
managed to escape Portiforo’s vengeance—which contingency<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
was extremely doubtful—he was going to be
put out of the service for acting in a manner unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman. But, just the
same, he kept the muzzle of his revolver pressed
against the stomach of the chief gentleman of Baracoa.
For he was not Lieutenant Ridder, of the United
States navy at that moment. He was plain John Ridder,
of New York City, who had once had the life
almost kicked out of him by a gang of toughs in New
York’s Chinatown, and who, ever since then, had been
yearning for an opportunity to pay his debt to the
plucky young man who had saved him from that fate.
Possibly his actions were influenced also by the consideration
that while the person whom he was threatening
was the ruler of a friendly nation, he was also a
tyrant and a usurper, and that his rascality might be
revealed to the world if only Hawley could get away
with the photographic proof of the dastardly conspiracy.</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mr. Portiforo, that I do mean exactly
what I say,” he said quietly. “You had better
instruct your soldiers to let go of my friend and permit
him to enter the launch, for as sure as there are bullets
in this gun—and I hope, for your sake, you have
no doubts on that score—if they attempt to stop him
there’s going to be an immediate change of administration
in Baracoa.”</p>

<p>Desperate as was his act, it might have succeeded,
for the soldiers who held the Camera Chap captive, appreciating
the peril of their president, looked to the
latter irresolutely for instructions, and Portiforo,<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
realizing that, temporarily, at least, this rash young
man with the bulldog jaw held, as he had boasted,
the trump card, was about to give orders to his soldiers
to do as Ridder demanded. But just at that moment,
the naval officer’s arms were pinned to his sides,
and his right wrist was grasped so tightly that the revolver
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>A second launch from the battleship had landed
quietly at the fortress, and two men, disembarking
therefrom, had run along the beach toward the group.
It was one of these men who, taking in the situation,
had crept up stealthily behind Ridder and taken him
by surprise.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant struggled in the grasp of his assailant
and a half dozen of the soldiers who went to
the latter’s assistance, Portiforo’s face resumed its
normal hue, and he expressed his relief by a hearty
chuckle.</p>

<p>“Well done, Captain Reyes!” he cried approvingly.
“Splendid work, my brave Ernesto!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">GALE TURNS A TRICK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Virginia Throgmorton, congratulating herself upon
the success of the ruse by which she hoped to get Captain
Reyes safely out of the way while the Camera
Chap was carrying out his daring plan, had received
an unpleasant surprise when the launch containing the
Baracoan army officer, Gale, and herself reached the
landing at Puerto Cabero.</p>

<p>Instead of disembarking there, Reyes had turned
apologetically to the girl. “I am filled with a thousand
regrets, señorita, to be compelled to transfer the
privilege of escorting you to your home to our friend
Señor Gale,” he said. “Not for a great deal would I
forego the opportunity, but a soldier must place duty
before pleasure, and I find I have an important duty
to perform which demands my immediate attention.”</p>

<p>“A duty!” Virginia exclaimed apprehensively.
“Where? Are you going back to the battleship?”</p>

<p>The Baracoan’s reply had filled her with dismay.
“No, señorita; I am going to the fortress,” he announced.</p>

<p>The significant smile which accompanied these words
increased the girl’s apprehensions. “But I do not wish
Mr. Gale to escort me home,” she objected, refusing
to recognize defeat. “In fact, there are reasons why
I cannot consent to that arrangement. I must insist
that you go with me, Captain Reyes. I shall be terribly
disappointed if you don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[283]</span></p>

<p>“I am sorry, señorita,” he answered firmly, “but I
am compelled to deny myself the pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go back to the battleship,” Virginia announced,
with sudden decision. “I have changed my
mind about going home.”</p>

<p>The captain bowed. “Very well, señorita. But I
must ask you to be good enough to go a little out of
your way. I presume you won’t object to putting me
down at the fortress first.”</p>

<p>The girl frowned. Her one idea, now, was to return
to the <em>Kearsarge</em> in the hope that she might be
able to intercept Hawley before he set out on his
hazardous expedition, and warn him that their plan
had gone awry. “I hate to be disobliging,” she said
to Reyes, “but you will have to wait.” She turned
to the sailor at the wheel. “Back to the battleship—as
quickly as you can,” she requested quietly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the Baracoan. “But I
must insist. My business is urgent. We will first go
to the fortress.”</p>

<p>Virginia gave him an indignant glance. “I think
you are horrid to-night, Captain Reyes! I did not
think that you could be so rude to a woman. However,”
she continued, suddenly changing her mind as
a new idea came to her, “it shall be as you say. We
will take you to your fortress first. After all, it will
mean only a few minutes’ delay.”</p>

<p>Reyes and Gale exchanged a smile of triumph. Possibly
they would not have felt so jubilant, however, if
they had guessed what Virginia had in mind. It
had occurred to her that it might be too late to intercept<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
Hawley, that he might already have started out
for the fortress, in which case she believed she saw a
way of rendering him valuable assistance by assenting
to Reyes’ request.</p>

<p>As they drew near to El Torro, which loomed up
blue-black in the moonlight, they caught sight of another
navy launch heading for the fortress, and the
girl’s pretty face became grim. She knew who was
in that boat.</p>

<p>Reyes and Gale appeared to have the same knowledge.
They jumped to their feet excitedly. “Hurry!”
the Baracoan cried tensely to the man at the wheel.
“If you get us there before that other boat lands I will
make it well worth your while.”</p>

<p>But the jack-tar paid no attention to what he said.
He was listening at that moment to Virginia, who had
leaned forward and was whispering something in his
ear.</p>

<p>In response to her request, the man grinned, and,
giving the wheel a sharp turn, changed the craft’s
course, at the same time slackening her speed.</p>

<p>“What are you doing!” Reyes cried angrily, aghast
at this maneuver. “I am Captain Reyes, of the army
of Baracoa. If you don’t obey my orders, my man,
you will get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’d better do as he says!” exclaimed Gale, addressing
the sailor threateningly. “He is a guest of
your ship, and an intimate friend of Captain Cortrell.”</p>

<p>“And I am Miss Throgmorton, the daughter of the
United States minister,” Virginia said, observing that<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
the man at the wheel seemed to hesitate. “If you do
as I tell you, I will answer for it that everything will
be all right. Pay no attention to these men.”</p>

<p>The jack-tar grinned, and the launch kept to her new
course—away from El Torro. Virginia laughed happily
as she viewed the discomfiture of the pair.</p>

<p>“You will not be so merry, to-morrow, señorita,”
the Baracoan said to her savagely. “You will get into
great trouble for this service you have rendered to
the enemies of our government—and, this time, neither
your sex nor your father’s influence will save you.”</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. “To-morrow is
a long way off,” she informed him serenely. “Lots of
things can happen before then.”</p>

<p>A little later an exclamation of dismay came from
Gale. His eyes were turned anxiously toward the
fortress. It was a clear moonlight night, and, although
they were some distance off, he could discern
what was taking place on the beach. The other launch
had landed, and a tall figure had gone ashore. “He’s
getting away with it!” the <cite>News</cite> man growled, as he
saw the flash of light go up from behind the clump of
bushes, and, immediately afterward, caught sight of
the dim outline of a man running toward the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>A laugh, half hysterical, came from Virginia, but
it changed suddenly to an involuntary cry of despair.
A shadowy group had rushed out from the fortress
and seized the fugitive.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to her distress was the delight<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
of Reyes and Gale. “Hurrah! They’ve got him!”
the reporter cried. “Congratulations, Ernesto, old
sport! We may have missed the first part of the performance,
but at all events we shall be in time for the
finale.”</p>

<p>Reyes turned with a mocking smile to Virginia.
“Now that your charming little conspiracy has failed,
perhaps you won’t mind permitting us to go ashore,
señorita,” he suggested. “You must realize that it
can no longer do you any good to hold us here.”</p>

<p>The girl sighed. “Yes; you might as well let them
land now,” she instructed the sailor at the wheel.
“As he says, nothing is to be gained by detaining them
any longer.”</p>

<p>The launch landed some distance away from the
point where the Camera Chap was struggling in the
grasp of the captives. As Reyes and the reporter ran
eagerly along the beach toward the group, they saw
Lieutenant Ridder suddenly project himself into the
tableau and threaten Portiforo with a revolver.</p>

<p>They did not know, then, that the man thus threatened
was Portiforo. They had no expectation of finding
the president there, for his visit to the fortress
had been in the nature of a little surprise party to
the garrison. But, as they drew nearer, Gale recognized
the corpulent form of the chief executive of
Baracoa, and announced his discovery to his companion,
who promptly proceeded to distinguish himself by
stealing up behind Ridder and throwing his arms
around that reckless young man.</p>

<p>“Excellently done, my brave Ernesto!” Portiforo<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
chuckled as the soldiers went to Reyes’ assistance and
took charge of the discomfited American naval officer.
“Possibly, señor,” he sneered, addressing Ridder,
“you will regret, now, that you did not take advantage
of my good nature and go back to your ship while you
had the chance. Of course, after the outrage you
have committed, you must realize that your uniform
cannot save you from the consequences of your mad
act.”</p>

<p>Ridder shrugged his shoulders. “I’m ready to take
my medicine,” he said quietly. “I trust, however, Mr.
President,” he added anxiously, pointing to the three
sailors who had followed him ashore, “you will not
find it necessary to hold these men. They have done
nothing.”</p>

<p>Portiforo held a brief debate with himself, and decided
to permit the sailors to return to the <em>Kearsarge</em>.
They appeared to be loath to leave their young officer,
who was very popular with all the men, but he smilingly
ordered them to go, and they put back to the
ship in the launch.</p>

<p>“Take these rascals and lock them both up!” the
president commanded fiercely, pointing to the Camera
Chap and the navy man. “Until further orders, nobody
is to be permitted to communicate with either
of them. But wait a minute! There is one little detail
which almost escaped my attention. Before we
lock him up, we will first relieve Señor Hawley of the
camera with which he took that audacious flash-light
picture.”</p>

<p>“Here it is, Señor Presidente,” announced Gale,<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
bending down and picking up a small pocket kodak
which was lying on the ground near the Camera Chap’s
feet and handing it to Portiforo. “Guess he was trying
to get rid of the evidence,” he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Señor Gale,” said the president, regarding
the camera with great satisfaction. “This is
a dainty little thing. We will have the film developed
as soon as possible,” he continued, with a sardonic
smile. “I have heard much of Señor Hawley’s great
skill as a photographer, and I am most anxious to see
for myself what kind of work he can do.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me have a copy of the picture, Señor
Presidente?” the <cite>News</cite> reporter requested, seemingly
with great eagerness.</p>

<p>A scowl darkened Portiforo’s face for an instant.
Then he smiled and shook his head. “It is painful to
me to have to refuse you anything, my friend,” he
said, “but I fear that would be impossible.”</p>

<p>Gale appeared to be keenly disappointed, but his demeanor
was only a pose; for he had every reason to
believe that when the film was developed, the result
would be a blank, inasmuch as he knew that the camera
which he had handed Portiforo had never been used.</p>

<p>The <cite>News</cite> man, himself, had bought that camera,
a few days previously, in San Cristobal, and had carried
it in his pocket when he went to the <em>Kearsarge</em>
dinner, anticipating that it might come in handy.
Being rather clever at sleight-of-hand work, it had
been a simple matter for him to drop his own kodak,
unseen, at the Camera Chap’s feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[289]</span></p>

<p>With equal dexterity, he had pocketed the small
camera which Hawley had used to take the flash-light
picture of President Felix, and which, a few minutes
earlier, he, alone, had observed the Camera Chap attempt
to conceal by thrusting it into some bushes near
which he was standing.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">A LITTLE KEEPSAKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Later that night, Gale returned to San Cristobal
very well satisfied with himself and his evening’s
work. He had every reason to believe that he carried
in his pocket the photographic proof of President
Felix’s incarceration in El Torro fortress; for he
deemed it exceedingly unlikely that Hawley would
have ventured to take the flash light unless he had
found Felix; and, as for the picture turning out successfully,
knowing the Camera Chap’s skill as a snapshotter
and his ability to get results, even under the
most unfavorable technical conditions, the <cite>News</cite> man
felt sanguine on that score.</p>

<p>He thrilled with anticipatory joy as he pictured to
himself the glory which would be his when his paper
should startle the world by launching his big photographic
scoop. But keen though he was to have the
film developed, he felt constrained to postpone that
detail for a few days. He did not possess the necessary
knowledge or materials with which to do the
work himself, and, although there were a couple of
studios in San Cristobal which made a specialty of
doing developing and printing for amateur photographers,
he was afraid to trust the precious film to
them, particularly as they were run by natives who
might recognize the subject of his picture. So he decided
to wait until he got to New York and have the<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
negative developed by the experts in the <cite>Daily News</cite>
office.</p>

<p>There was a boat leaving Puerto Cabero for New
York the following morning, and he resolved to book
passage on her. His work being done, there was nothing
now to keep him in Baracoa, except possibly his
desire to wait to see what was going to happen to the
Camera Chap. It would have filled his mean, malicious
soul with joy to be able to go back to Park Row
and boast to “the boys” that he had been a personal
eyewitness of the snapshot adventurer’s fate, but he
put the temptation aside, resolved to subordinate pleasure
to duty. He realized the necessity of getting the
picture of Felix to his paper as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>Before he sailed, however, he at least had the satisfaction
of learning definitely what his rival’s fate was
to be. Justice in Baracoa, under the Portiforo administration,
was swift—on occasions. The country
being under martial law on account of the revolution,
the case of the Camera Chap and Lieutenant Ridder,
of the United States navy, was tried before a military
court. The court convened that morning, and,
after less than an hour’s deliberation, arrived at a verdict
that the interests of the government of Baracoa
demanded that capital punishment should be the fate
of both prisoners, and that the sentence of the court
should be carried out within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>When Minister Throgmorton heard of these verdicts
he hurried to the palace and held a long conference
with the president. After his visit, it was officially announced
that the government of Baracoa had decided<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
to pardon one of the two American prisoners. The
man who was to receive clemency, it was stated, was
Lieutenant Ridder. Although his offense was grievous,
President Portiforo was disposed to be magnanimous,
and if the state department at Washington
would give its assurance that the young man would be
dishonorably dismissed from the United States navy,
he would be allowed to go free within a few days.</p>

<p>In the case of Señor Hawley, however, the government
of Baracoa announced there could be no deviation
from the sentence of the court. This was the second
time he had offended, and President Portiforo
felt that he must be made an example of, “as a lesson
to all those who espoused the revolutionary cause.”</p>

<p>Virginia was in despair when she heard the tidings
from her father. “I have done my best,” the latter
assured her. “I have argued and pleaded with President
Portiforo on behalf of Hawley, but find it impossible
to persuade him to mitigate the sentence of
that unfortunate young man.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have got him to postpone the carrying
out of the sentence for a few days?” the girl said
bitterly. “That would have given us time to do something.”</p>

<p>The diplomat shook his head. “I did my best,” he
repeated. “Portiforo positively refused to grant even
a stay of execution in Hawley’s case. I had great difficulty
in persuading him to extend clemency to Ridder,
and that was the most that I was able to accomplish.
He was absolutely obdurate as regards the other prisoner.
He informed me that he wouldn’t grant any<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
mercy to Hawley, even if the President of the United
States were to ask it of him as a personal favor.”</p>

<p>He viewed his daughter’s distress with solicitude.
“I am extremely sorry, my dear,” he said gently; “although
I am not favorably impressed with Mr. Hawley,
and still less so with the odious yellow journal he
represents. I should have liked to get him out of his
scrape, for your sake—now that you have confided to
me the depth of your feeling toward him.”</p>

<p>Preceding Minister Throgmorton’s visit to the palace,
Virginia, in her desire to save the Camera Chap,
had laid bare to her father the innermost secret of
her heart. He had been amazed by the revelation.
He had known all along, of course, of the friendship
that existed between her and Hawley, but inasmuch as
they had known each other only a few weeks, he had
not suspected the full extent of her regard for the
photographic adventurer. His daughter’s happiness
being more to him than any other consideration, he had
put aside his own prejudices and really had done his
utmost to persuade his friend Portiforo to spare Hawley’s
life.</p>

<p>“There is just one concession that I was able to
wring from the president,” the minister now announced.
“It isn’t much, my poor girl, but it may
give you a little comfort: He has consented to permit
you to see the prisoner. Personally, my dear, I
would advise against your availing yourself of this
privilege. Such a meeting, I fear, would only add
to your distress. However, I will permit you to follow
your own wishes in the matter. If you desire to<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
go to the prison, here is a pass which the president
made out for you.”</p>

<p>Virginia took the paper from him with pathetic
eagerness, and less than five minutes later she was
speeding on her way to the fortress.</p>

<p>The meeting between her and the president’s photographic
envoy took place under somewhat disadvantageous
circumstances. Two of the prison officials
insisted on being present during the interview,
and Virginia was not allowed to enter the cell; she had
to converse with the condemned man through the
bars.</p>

<p>She found the Camera Chap apparently resigned to
his fate. His face was pale and haggard, but he bore
himself with a cheerfulness that amazed her, great
as was her estimate of his courage.</p>

<p>“Brace up, little girl,” he said gently, putting out his
hand to her through the bars. “You mustn’t take it
like that, you know. Things haven’t turned out exactly
as pleasant as we had hoped,” he continued, with
a whimsical smile, “but I assure you that I am not a
bit sorry I came to Baracoa. If I hadn’t, I should
never have had the privilege of knowing you, and I
assure you that blessed privilege is ample compensation
for—whatever is coming my way later on.”</p>

<p>Presently he inquired of the two prison officials
whether he would be permitted to dispose of some of
his personal effects as keepsakes, and they told him
that there would be no objection to this proceeding,
which was a privilege always granted to condemned
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[295]</span></p>

<p>Eagerly he drew from his finger a seal ring, and
handed it to Virginia. “I ask you to be good enough
to wear this as a souvenir of our friendship,” he said.
He smiled ruefully. “I had hoped to present it to you
under more favorable circumstances. And there is
one other favor I would beg of you to grant: I have
a friend in New York who, I feel sure, would be glad
to receive a keepsake from me. Tom Paxton, managing
editor of the New York <cite>Sentinel</cite>, has always
admired this tobacco pouch of mine.” He took from
his pocket a leather pouch of unique design. “I would
like him to have it. It isn’t much, but I know he will
appreciate the circumstances under which it is given.
Yes,” he repeated, with peculiar emphasis, “I am quite
sure he will appreciate the circumstances. Would you
mind seeing that he gets it, Miss Throgmorton?”</p>

<p>As the girl took the pouch which he held to her, she
noted an expression on Hawley’s face which puzzled
her.</p>

<p>It was not until she had arrived at the boat landing
at Puerto Cabero that a suspicion of the truth dawned
upon her mind. With a sudden thrill of hope, she
opened the leather wallet with frantic eagerness, and
an exclamation of delight escaped from her lips.
Underneath a thin covering of granulated tobacco, the
pouch contained a small cylindrical article, the nature
of which Virginia immediately recognized. It was a
light-proof roll of film from a small pocket camera.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE DEVELOPED FILM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For a few seconds Virginia stood staring as though
fascinated at the little significant package in her hand,
but was brought to herself by a sudden consciousness
that somebody was standing close by her watching her
intently. She raised her eyes and encountered those of
the soft-footed Señor Lopez. There was an expression
on the spy’s face which caused the girl to thrust the
film roll and the pouch hurriedly into the hand bag
she was carrying, and to step hastily into the automobile
waiting for her at the wharf.</p>

<p>“Home, señorita?” the native chauffeur inquired.</p>

<p>She was about to give an affirmative response, but
suddenly changed her mind as an idea came to her.
“No,” she answered. “Take me to the residence of
Sir Godfrey Montague, the British minister, as quickly
as you can.”</p>

<p>As the car started, she glanced back, and saw that
Lopez was just entering another automobile. She
guessed that the man was about to attempt to follow
her, and a grim expression came to her face as she
opened her hand bag and tentatively examined a
dainty, pearl-handled, little revolver which was among
its contents. Her fears, however, so far as Lopez were
concerned, proved groundless, for when her car arrived
in San Cristobal and drew up in front of the
British embassy, the spy was not in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>Virginia sent in her card to Beatrice Montague, the
diplomat’s daughter. She knew that the latter was
an enthusiastic amateur photographer and did her own
developing and printing—which was the reason she
had decided to call upon her now.</p>

<p>“I want you to do me a favor, Beatrice,” she said,
as soon as the English girl came into the reception
room to greet her. “I have a film here which I want
developed and a print made from it as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” the other responded, wondering greatly
at her visitor’s flushed face and agitated manner.
“Come up to the dark room, dear. I didn’t know that
you, too, had become a camera fiend.”</p>

<p>She led the way upstairs to the chamber which
she had fitted up as her laboratory. Here, under the
rays of a ruby lamp, the girls opened the roll of film
and submerged it in the necessary chemical solutions.
A little later, as her friend held the wet gelatin against
the lamp, Virginia gave vent to a joyous cry. “He
did it!” she exclaimed, with a hysterical laugh. “He
has succeeded, after all.”</p>

<p>“Who did what?” Miss Montague asked curiously.
“What is this negative, Virginia? It looks to me like
an old man gazing out of a barred window.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” her visitor answered happily.
“An old man gazing out of a barred window. How
soon can you let me have a print of this, Beatrice?
Please hurry. Every minute counts.”</p>

<p>In a little while the picture was ready. As the<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
British minister’s daughter took it out of the printing
frame, she stared in astonishment at the finished
product. In its negative form, of course, she had not
been able to identify the subject; but now it occurred
to her that there was something hauntingly familiar
about the haggard, wistful face that peered at her
from the barred window.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen this man before somewhere,” she announced;
“but I can’t recall where——” She stopped
short, and an expression of astonishment came to her
face. “How extraordinary!” she exclaimed. “Do you
know, my dear, if it weren’t so very absurd, I should
say that this was a snapshot of former President
Felix. To be sure, it looks much older than he did
at the time of his disappearance, but the features are
very much like his, as I recall them. It is truly a remarkable
resemblance.”</p>

<p>Virginia smiled. “Isn’t it, though? Please hurry
up and finish this print so that it won’t fade. I’ll tell
you all about it later on, but I haven’t time now.”
Without waiting for the print to dry, she placed it in
her hand bag and hurried out to the waiting automobile.
“Back to Puerto Cabero—as fast as we can go,”
she said to her chauffeur.</p>

<p>As she spoke, she glanced up the street and caught
sight of another automobile standing at the corner. In
that car sat Señor Lopez. She saw him bend forward
in his seat and give an order to his driver, and she was
not surprised, when her car started, to observe that
the other followed. The discovery prompted her to
take the precaution of transferring the precious snapshot<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
from her bag to her blouse, but evidently the spy
was content with merely watching her movements and
had no intention of trying to wrest the picture from
her, for he trailed behind her car all the way to the
seaport, and once when their motor broke down on a
lonely stretch of road and they had to stop ten minutes
for repairs, Lopez’s chariot also came to a halt a short
distance behind.</p>

<p>A launch from the <em>Kearsarge</em> was waiting at the
wharf as the girl stepped from the automobile and
went down to the water’s edge. She inquired of one
of the crew whether the captain was on board the warship,
and, receiving an affirmative response, requested
to be taken out to him immediately.</p>

<p>Captain Cortrell received her with a grim smile. “I
can guess the object of your visit, Miss Throgmorton,”
he said sadly. “But I regret to say that I am powerless
to do anything in behalf of—— Why, what is
this?” He stared in astonishment at the picture the
girl had handed him.</p>

<p>“Who sent this photograph?” he demanded, an eager
expression on his weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hawley,” she answered. “He couldn’t bring
it himself,” she explained with a smile, “so I undertook
to be his messenger. I was in hopes that it might
alter the situation so far as he is concerned.”</p>

<p>Without an apology, the battleship’s commander
turned from her and disappeared inside his cabin, leaving
Virginia standing outside. He opened a drawer
of his desk, and took therefrom the bulky envelope that
contained his sealed orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[300]</span></p>

<p>When he returned to Virginia, a few minutes later,
his face was wreathed in smiles. “You were right,
Miss Throgmorton,” he said, “in assuming that the
picture you have brought me from Mr. Hawley would
alter the situation. It has changed matters considerably.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">TWO LACONIC ORDERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While the American minister’s daughter was visiting
the <em>Kearsarge’s</em> commander, Señor Lopez was
dashing back to the capital, working the motor of his
car to its utmost capacity in his desire to get there as
soon as possible. He had watched the girl go aboard
the warship, and then he had proceeded to the fortress.
What he learned there had caused him to realize the
necessity of reaching the palace without delay.</p>

<p>President Portiforo was in consultation with his
cabinet when the spy reached the palace. They were
discussing a dispatch which had recently arrived, and
that the missive contained news of a startling character
was evident from the worried, scared expression
on the countenance of the chief executive of
Baracoa.</p>

<p>“The report seems incredible,” Portiforo declared,
his voice quavering. “If it is true—and I suppose
there can be no doubt of that—I must admit that thing
looks bad—exceedingly bad. Villa’s defeat is a blow
we can scarcely hope to survive. There is now practically
nothing to keep Rodriguez from reaching the
capital. By forced marches he ought to be here within
another twenty-four hours.” A sickly smile creased
his face. “By this time to-morrow the crowds on the
street will shout: ‘Viva el Presidente Rodriguez!’
It looks to me, gentlemen, as if the time had come for<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
us to take a little trip abroad for the benefit of our
health.”</p>

<p>The members of his cabinet received this suggestion
with gloomy nods of assent.</p>

<p>Portiforo leaned forward in his chair. “But before
we go,” he went on, lowering his voice, “there is one
little matter we must not overlook. To-morrow, no
doubt, the enemy will be in possession of El Torro.”
He turned to a tall, bearded man with a very pale face
who sat at his right hand. “Surely you will agree
with me, my dear Replife, that before that happens
we must do—what would have been done long ere
this if it had not been for your sentimental objections.”</p>

<p>Minister of War Replife, just out of the hospital,
sighed, and a shadow flitted across his pallid countenance.
“I don’t like it,” he said hoarsely. “I can’t
bear the thought of it. It is impossible for me to forget
that he was once my friend. We have done him
enough wrong, as it is, without——”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to think of ourselves now,” Portiforo
broke in impatiently. “This is no time for maudlin
sentiment, my friend. Unless we—er—take steps to
remove the evidence, by to-morrow night the whole
world will know our secret, and there will be no refuge
for us, wherever we may flee. As political refugees,
we should be received with honor and sympathy
abroad, but as fugitive criminals we could not expect
nearly so pleasant a reception.”</p>

<p>All the members of the cabinet except Replife received
this argument with approval. While they were<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
discussing it, a secretary entered the room and announced
that the spy, Lopez, was outside insisting
that he must see the president immediately on a matter
of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>Lopez was admitted at once. The tidings he brought
caused Portiforo and his cabinet to exchange glances
of alarm.</p>

<p>“You are positive that it was a roll of film Miss
Throgmorton had in her hand?” the president inquired.</p>

<p>“I am absolutely sure of that, Señor Presidente.
And I am equally sure that she took it to the British
minister’s residence to have the film developed, and
that the picture is now in the hands of the commander
of the Yankee warship.”</p>

<p>A scowl darkened the president’s bloated face.
“Then why didn’t you get it away from her?” he
growled. “Surely you must have had plenty of opportunity.”</p>

<p>Lopez bared his large, exceedingly white teeth in
a deprecatory smile. “If I had known then what I
know now, of course I should have taken that step,
Señor Presidente—although I am not a man of violence.
But I must admit that Señorita Throgmorton’s
actions puzzled me—until after I had been to the fortress.
I was content to watch her, to find out what
it all meant. But when I learned at the fortress that
the prisoner Hawley had handed her a tobacco pouch
to send as a keepsake to his editor, the significance of
that incident dawned upon me. I happen to know
that the daughter of the British minister is an amateur<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
photographer, so it was easy to guess why
Señorita Throgmorton visited her—and why she then
hurried to the Yankee warship.”</p>

<p>The scowl on Portiforo’s face deepened. “But I
can’t understand how that confounded photographer
could have managed to retain possession of the snapshot!”
he muttered. “I took his camera away from
him that night, and it was loaded with film.”</p>

<p>Lopez shrugged his shoulders. “Señor Hawley is
an exceedingly ingenious and resourceful young man,”
he remarked. “After the several exhibitions of his
cleverness which he has given us, I think we can assume
that he had the sagacity and foresight to change
the film roll of his camera immediately after taking
the picture.”</p>

<p>The president nodded gloomily. “Yes; he might
have done it that way. We ought to have been more
careful in searching him afterward,” he said. “I suppose,
my dear Replife,” he continued, turning with
a grim smile to the secretary of war, “you now fully
agree with the rest of us as to the necessity of carrying
out immediately the step we were discussing. The
startling news that Lopez has brought us emphasizes
the danger of delaying the matter.”</p>

<p>General Replife shook his head. “On the contrary,
I think the news which Lopez has brought is a
strong argument why you should spare the life of the
unhappy Felix,” he urged. “What good would it do
you to put him out of the way now? Such a step
would only make things worse for ourselves. The
photographic evidence of our guilt is now in the hands<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
of the United States government. Whether he is
found in El Torro or not, the world will know from
that snapshot that he <em>was</em> locked up there. And if he
is done away with it will, of course, add to the price
which we will have to pay later on.”</p>

<p>Some of Portiforo’s advisers were impressed by this
argument. They looked at their chief anxiously. The
latter leaned back in his chair, a look of uncertainty
on his face. It was evident from his demeanor that he
appreciated the force of this plea for their victim’s
life.</p>

<p>Then suddenly his beady eyes snapped, and his cruel
lips parted in a snarl. “We will take our chances on
the price we may have to pay—if we are caught,” he
said. “There is a possibility that we shall be able to
convince the world that the snapshot is a daring fraud.
Photographic evidence has been manufactured before
now; and”—he smiled sardonically—“the man who
took the picture will not, then, be here to refute our
claims.”</p>

<p>He reached for pen and paper on the big mahogany
table before him, and began to write rapidly. When
he had finished, he turned to Lopez. “Go back to
the fortress and deliver these immediately,” he said to
him. “One of them is for the commandant; the other
for Captain Reyes. Wait there until both orders are
carried out, and then come back and report.”</p>

<p>Lopez bowed, and put the two papers in his pocket.
Then he hurried back to Puerto Cabero. During the
journey, he read the two papers, and their contents
caused him to bare his teeth in a malicious smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[306]</span></p>

<p>The missive addressed to Captain Reyes was somewhat
ambiguous. It said merely, “The time has
come.”</p>

<p>Portiforo knew Reyes would have no difficulty in
grasping the purport of that laconic sentence. The
other order, addressed to the commandant of the fortress,
was less vaguely worded. It commanded that
official to proceed immediately with the execution of
the American prisoner, Hawley.</p>

<p>Before two hours had elapsed, Lopez returned to
the palace. The cabinet members had departed. Portiforo
was in his private suite, nervously pacing the
floor.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said hoarsely, as his envoy entered.
“Has it been done?”</p>

<p>The spy shook his head. His face was white, his
manner agitated. His breath came in great gasps, as
though he had been running hard.</p>

<p>“I was too late, Señor Presidente,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Too late?”</p>

<p>“When I arrived there, I found El Torro in possession
of marines from the <em>Kearsarge</em>. I can’t understand
how they managed it—I didn’t wait to gather
particulars—but they took the garrison by surprise,
and captured the fortress with scarcely a struggle.”</p>

<p>Portiforo sank weakly into a chair. “Incredible!”
he gasped. “And the prisoners?”</p>

<p>Lopez made a despairing gesture. “I regret to say
that our birds have flown, Señor Presidente. Felix,
Hawley, and Ridder are now safely aboard the Yankee
warship.”</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">BESIDE THE GREAT GUN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the captain’s cabin of the <em>Kearsarge</em> a white-haired,
emaciated man, with tears streaming down his
pallid cheeks, was vociferously assuring the commander
of the warship of his undying gratitude.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, you don’t owe any thanks to me,” the
latter protested gruffly. “The man to whom you owe
your freedom is Mr. Hawley. Anxious though I was
to serve you, I could have done nothing if it hadn’t
been for him.”</p>

<p>President Felix raised his faded eyes to the beamed
ceiling of the cabin. “And to think that I misjudged
the motives of that heroic young man!” he said remorsefully.
“It seemed to me preposterous that he
could save me with his camera. I did him the injustice
of supposing that he was merely a professional
photographer trying to get a sensational picture and
not caring what happened to me afterward as a result
of his exploit.”</p>

<p>“And yet you assisted him by standing at the bars
of your dungeon and posing for his camera?” Captain
Cortrell exclaimed, in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>A glow came to the liberated martyr’s eyes. “That
was because I saw the possibility of being vindicated
in the eyes of the world,” he replied. “That was all
that I dared hope for, señor—vindication, not freedom.
I believed that Mr. Hawley’s daring exploit<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
would cause my enemies to resort to desperate measures,
but I was in hopes that afterward—after my
death—the picture might be published in the United
States and my reputation cleared. Even if Mr. Hawley
had done me only that service, it would have been
enough,” he added fervently.</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, he was able to accomplish
more than that,” said the naval officer heartily.</p>

<p>“How shall I ever be able to repay him?” said Felix
brokenly.</p>

<p>While this conversation was taking place in the captain’s
cabin, the Camera Chap was standing under
the shadow of one of the warship’s great guns, looking
into the blue eyes of Virginia Throgmorton, and earnestly
assuring her that to her alone was due the successful
outcome of his adventure.</p>

<p>“I was sure, when I handed you that pouch, that
you would grasp the idea,” he said, a note of profound
admiration in his voice. “Any other girl might have
failed to understand.”</p>

<p>Virginia laughed and blushed at the same time. “I
am so glad that I did understand,” she said earnestly.
“It wasn’t cleverness, of course—it was just instinct.
But suppose I had taken you literally and sent on that
keepsake to your friend, Mr. Paxton, without examining
it!” She shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>Hawley smiled grimly. “In that event, I guess the
<cite>Sentinel</cite> would have had a big picture scoop. Tom
Paxton would have realized what that film meant, of
course, as soon as he saw it, and would have played up<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
the snapshot for all it was worth.” Suddenly he smiled
as a thought came to him. “What has become of our
friend Gale?”</p>

<p>Virginia informed him that the <cite>News</cite> man had gone
back to New York.</p>

<p>“I supposed as much,” Hawley chuckled. “I guess
he was in a hurry to go back to his office and hand them
his big picture scoop. In spite of the seriousness of
the situation, I could scarcely keep from laughing, that
night, when I saw him fool Portiforo by pocketing my
camera and handing him another, not suspecting that
while he was working that cunning little trick he was
being hoaxed himself.” He chuckled again. “I would
give a whole lot to see his face when he arrives at the
<cite>News</cite> office and develops that perfectly blank film.”</p>

<p>Virginia frowned. “Serves him right,” she said.
“I don’t like to be vindictive, but I hope his editor discharges
him.” She sighed. “I can’t understand why
my father should have taken such a fancy to that contemptible
fellow. But then,” she added, with a rueful
smile, “poor dad has shown himself to be a very poor
judge of men.”</p>

<p>Hawley nodded.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for your father, Virginia. I presume
it will be a great blow to him—the way things have
turned out.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will,” the girl said wistfully. “He
had such great faith in that tyrant Portiforo. And
I suppose he will be asked to resign his post. It isn’t
to be expected that Washington will continue him
here under the circumstances. Personally I shall not<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
be sorry to return to the United States, but I fear that
dad will feel keenly the disgrace of being recalled.”</p>

<p>The Camera Chap made no comment on this, but
there was a thought in his mind which did not find
expression until a few days later when he arrived
at Washington and presented himself at the White
House.</p>

<p>The President of the United States received his
photographic envoy with marked cordiality, and gazed
appreciatively at the snapshot which the latter handed
him with the simple announcement: “Here is the picture,
Mr. President, which you instructed me to take.”</p>

<p>The chief executive smiled quizzically. “I must
compliment you on the manner in which you have carried
out my instructions, sir,” he said formally.
“Thank you for the picture. I fear that you must have
had considerable trouble in getting it.” Then suddenly
the quizzical smile left his face, and his hand
went out and grasped that of Hawley in a strenuous
grip. “Well done, sir,” he exclaimed, in a tone that
was by no means formal. “I shan’t forget your
splendid, plucky work, my boy.”</p>

<p>It was a little late when the subject of reward was
brought up, and the president was offering the Camera
Chap a lucrative position in the United States secret
service, that the latter spoke the thought which was
in his mind when he had that conversation with Virginia
on board the <em>Kearsarge</em>.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything for myself, sir,” Hawley
said. “But—if you won’t think me too presumptuous—I
would like to ask a favor on behalf of somebody<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
else. I understand that there is talk of Minister
Throgmorton being recalled as a result of the latest
developments in Baracoa. If you could see your way
to permit him to retain his post it would be giving
me a greater reward than I deserve.”</p>

<p>The president shook his head. “I regret to say that
is out of the question,” he replied. “I am convinced
that Mr. Throgmorton acted with perfect sincerity
in upholding Portiforo and refusing to believe the
rumor about the conspiracy against Felix, but a man
capable of such bad judgment is scarcely fit to represent
this government abroad. Besides, Mr. Throgmorton
has no desire to continue in his post. He has
sent me his resignation to take effect immediately.
He feels naturally that it would be embarrassing to
him to remain in Baracoa under the Felix administration.
He and his daughter have sailed for the
United States.”</p>

<p>And the president wondered why this announcement
brought such a joyous expression to the Camera
Chap’s face.</p>

<p>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
